  "ingredients": [
    "3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature",
    "1/2 cup sugar",
    "1/2 teaspoon salt",
    "3 ounces bittersweet chocolate, melted and cooled",
    "2 cups all-purpose flour",
    "3/4 cup finely chopped almonds",
    "1/2 cup thick seedless raspberry jam"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Grease 2 large baking sheets.",
    "In a large bowl, with an electric mixer on medium speed, beat the butter, sugar, and salt until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add the melted chocolate and beat until well blended, scraping the sides of the bowl. Stir in the flour until smooth.",
    "Place the nuts in a shallow bowl. Shape the dough into 1-inch balls. Roll the balls in the nuts, pressing lightly so they will adhere. Place the balls about 1 1/2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets.",
    "With the handle end of a wooden spoon, poke a deep hole in each ball of dough, molding the dough around the handle to maintain the round shape. Place about 1/4 teaspoon jam in each cookie. (Do not add more jam, as it may melt and leak out when the cookies bake.)",
    "Bake the cookies 18 to 20 minutes, or until the jam is bubbling and the cookies are lightly browned. Have ready 2 wire cooling racks.",
    "Transfer the baking sheets to the racks. Let the cookies cool 5 minutes on the baking sheets, then transfer them to the wire racks to cool completely. Store in an airtight container up to 2 weeks."
