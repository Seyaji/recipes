    "introduction": "Polenta, a staple of Italian cuisine, is traditionally prepared by slowly stirring cornmeal into boiling water, demanding patience and precision. However, this foolproof method ensures a lump-free, creamy texture by initially mixing the cornmeal with cold water. This dish can be varied by using broth or milk and enriched with grated cheese.",
    "ingredients": [
      "4 cups cold water",
      "1 cup coarsely ground yellow cornmeal, preferably stone-ground",
      "2 teaspoons salt",
      "2 tablespoons unsalted butter"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "1. In a 2-quart heavy saucepan, bring 3 cups water to a boil.",
      "2. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk together the cornmeal, salt, and remaining 1 cup water.",
      "3. Pour the mixture into the boiling water and cook, stirring, until the mixture comes to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the polenta is thick and creamy, about 30 minutes. If the polenta becomes too thick, stir in a little more water.",
      "4. Stir in the butter. Serve immediately."
    ],
    "variations": [
      "Cook polenta with broth instead of water for added flavor.",
      "Use milk in place of some of the water for a creamier texture.",
      "Stir in grated cheese at the end of cooking for a richer taste."
