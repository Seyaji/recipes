    "titleAlternative": "Cozze allo Zafferano",
    "yield": "Makes 4 servings",
    "introduction": "Saffron, a spice made from the stigmas of crocus flowers, adds an exotic flavor and beautiful color to these mussels. Though much of the world's saffron comes from Spain, it is also produced in the Abruzzo region of Italy. When buying saffron, always buy whole threads, which keep their flavor longer. Look for deep red-orange color. The darker color is an indication of better quality.",
    "ingredients": [
      "1 teaspoon saffron threads",
      "1 cup dry white wine",
      "4 pounds mussels",
      "1 medium onion, finely chopped",
      "1/3 cup olive oil",
      "1 cup peeled, seeded, and chopped ripe tomatoes",
      "6 basil leaves, torn into bits",
      "2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Soak the saffron in the white wine for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, soak the mussels in cold water for 30 minutes. Cut or pull off the beards. Discard any mussels with cracked shells or that do not close tightly when touched.",
      "In a large saucepan, cook the onion in the oil over medium heat until golden, about 10 minutes. Add the saffron, wine, and tomatoes and bring to a simmer. Stir in the basil and parsley.",
      "Add the mussels and cover the pan. Cook, shaking the pan occasionally, about 5 minutes or until the mussels begin to open.",
      "Transfer the opened mussels to individual serving bowls. Cook any mussels that remain closed a minute or two longer; discard any that do not open. Simmer the liquid 1 minute more and pour it over the mussels. Serve hot."
