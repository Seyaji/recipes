    "introduction": "Anisette Toast, also known as Biscotti di Anice, originates from southern Italy. These delightful cookies are flavored with anise, imparting a distinctive licorice essence. Adding a teaspoon of anise seeds to the batter can enhance this unique flavor even more. Often enjoyed as an after-dinner treat, they pair wonderfully with coffee or tea and are perfect for both casual snacking and special occasions.",
    "ingredients": [
      "2 large eggs, at room temperature",
      "1 tablespoon anisette liqueur or anise extract",
      "1/2 cup sugar",
      "1 cup all-purpose flour",
      "2 tablespoons cornstarch",
      "1 teaspoon baking powder"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Place a rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Grease a 9-inch square baking pan. Line the bottom of the pan with wax paper. Grease and flour the paper. Tap out the excess flour.",
      "In a large electric mixer bowl, combine the eggs, liqueur, and sugar. Begin beating the eggs on low speed, gradually increasing the speed to high. Continue to beat the eggs until they are very light and foamy and tripled in volume, about 5 minutes.",
      "Place the flour, cornstarch, and baking powder in a fine-mesh strainer. Shake the strainer over the egg mixture, gradually folding in the dry ingredients with a rubber spatula. Be careful not to deflate the eggs.",
      "Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top. Bake 20 to 25 minutes, or until firm when touched lightly in the center and golden brown. Have ready a large baking sheet and a large cooling rack.",
      "Remove the pan from the oven, but leave the oven turned on. Run a small knife around the edges of the pan. Invert the cake onto a cutting board.",
      "Raise the oven temperature to 375°F. With a long serrated knife, cut the cake into 3-inch strips. Cut each strip crosswise into 3/4-inch-thick slices. Place the slices in a single layer on a large baking sheet. Bake the slices 7 minutes or until toasted and golden.",
      "Remove the cookies from the oven and transfer to wire racks to cool. Store in a tightly covered container up to 2 weeks."
