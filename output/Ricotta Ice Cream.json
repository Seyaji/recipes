    "introduction": "Ricotta ice cream hails from Rome, where it's a beloved flavor at famed gelaterias like Giolitti. This rich and creamy dessert can be elevated with additions like chopped chocolate or pistachios, and is often enjoyed drizzled with orange liqueur or rum.",
    "ingredients": [
      "16 ounces fresh whole or part-skim ricotta",
      "1/2 cup sugar",
      "2 tablespoons sweet or dry Marsala",
      "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract",
      "1/2 cup chilled heavy or whipping cream",
      "2 tablespoons chopped citron",
      "2 tablespoons chopped candied orange zest"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "At least 20 minutes before making the dessert, place a large bowl and the beaters of an electric mixer in the refrigerator. Place the ricotta in a fine-mesh strainer set over a bowl. With a rubber spatula, push the ricotta through the strainer into the bowl. Whisk in the sugar, Marsala, and vanilla.",
      "Remove the bowl and beaters from the refrigerator. Pour the cream into the bowl and whip the cream at high speed until it holds its shape softly when the beaters are lifted, about 4 minutes.",
      "With a flexible spatula, fold the cream, citron, and zest into the ricotta mixture. Scrape the mixture into the container of an ice-cream maker and freeze according to the manufacturer's instructions.",
      "Pack the ice cream into a plastic container, cover, and freeze up to 24 hours."
