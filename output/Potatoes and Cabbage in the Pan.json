  "introduction": "Versions of this dish exist all over Italy. In Friuli, smoked pancetta is added to the skillet with the onion. This simple version from Basilicata lets the pale pink of the onion complement the creamy white potatoes and green cabbage. By the time the cabbage is tender, the potatoes become so soft they are like mashed potatoes.",
  "ingredients": [
    "3 tablespoons olive oil",
    "1 medium red onion, chopped",
    "1/2 head medium cabbage, thinly sliced (about 4 cups)",
    "3 medium all-purpose potatoes, such as Yukon gold, peeled and cut into bite-size pieces",
    "1/2 cup water",
    "Salt and freshly ground black pepper"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Pour the oil into a large skillet. Add the onion and cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until softened, about 5 minutes.",
    "Stir in the cabbage, potatoes, water, and salt and pepper to taste. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, 30 minutes or until the vegetables are soft. Add a little more water if the vegetables begin to stick. Serve hot."
