    "instructions": [
        "1. Place a barbecue grill or broiler rack about 4 inches from the source of the heat. Preheat the grill or broiler. Place the tomatoes on the grill. Cook, turning frequently with tongs, until the tomatoes are softened and the skin is lightly charred and loosened. Remove the tomatoes. Brush the eggplant and onion slices with oil and sprinkle them with salt and pepper. Grill until the vegetables are tender and browned but not blackened, about 5 minutes on each side.",
        "2. Slip off the tomato skins and cut out the stem ends. Place the tomatoes in a large serving bowl and mash them well with a fork. Stir in the garlic, basil, 1/4 cup oil, and salt and pepper to taste.",
        "3. Cut the eggplant and onions into thin strips and add them to the tomatoes.",
        "4. Bring at least 4 quarts of water to a boil in a large pot. Add 2 tablespoons of salt, then the pasta. Stir well. Cook over high heat, stirring frequently, until the pasta is al dente, tender yet firm to the bite. Set aside some of the cooking liquid.",
        "5. Drain the pasta. In a large serving bowl, toss the pasta with the vegetables. Add some of the cooking water if the pasta seems dry. Add the cheese and serve immediately."
