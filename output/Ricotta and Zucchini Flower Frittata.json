        "yield": "Makes 4 servings",
        "introduction": "Zucchini flowers are not only beautiful but also delicious to eatâ€”something Italians know well. This frittata is a delightful dish that combines the mild flavor of zucchini flowers with creamy ricotta, creating a delicate and delicious brunch option that is sure to impress.",
        "ingredients": [
            "2 tablespoons unsalted butter",
            "6 zucchini or other squash blossoms, rinsed and dried",
            "6 large eggs, beaten",
            "1/4 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano",
            "Salt and freshly ground pepper",
            "1 cup ricotta"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "In a 9-inch nonstick skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Place the zucchini flowers in the pan in a pinwheel fashion.",
            "In a medium bowl, beat together the eggs, Parmigiano, and salt and pepper to taste. Carefully pour the mixture over the flowers without disturbing them. Place spoonfuls of the ricotta around the pan. Lift the edges of the frittata as it sets to allow the uncooked egg to reach the surface of the pan. Cook until the eggs are just set but still moist in the center and the frittata is lightly browned on the bottom, about 5 to 10 minutes.",
            "Slide the frittata onto a plate, then invert the skillet over the plate. Quickly flip both the plate and skillet so that the frittata is cooked-side up. Cook until just set in the center, about 5 minutes more. Or, if you prefer not to flip it, slide the skillet under the broiler for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the eggs are set to taste. Serve hot or at room temperature."

            "It can also be made just with ricotta if you don't have zucchini flowers."
