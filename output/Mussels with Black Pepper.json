    "introduction": "Mussels with Black Pepper, also known as Impepata di Cozze in Naples, is a delightful seafood dish that showcases the tangy flavor of wine, lemon juice, and a generous amount of black pepper. Mussels, though sometimes tedious to clean, offer an enriching experience when cooked with aromatic garlic and fresh parsley. Farm-raised mussels are often recommended for their cleanliness and ease of preparation.",
    "ingredients": [
      "6 pounds mussels",
      "1/2 cup olive oil",
      "6 garlic cloves, finely chopped",
      "1/2 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley",
      "1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper",
      "1 cup dry white wine",
      "1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Soak the mussels in cold water for 30 minutes. Cut or pull off the beards. Discard any mussels with cracked shells or those that do not close tightly when touched.",
      "Pour the oil into a large pot. Add the garlic. Cook over medium heat until golden, about 1 minute. Stir in the parsley and pepper. Add the mussels, wine, and lemon juice to the pot. Cover and cook, shaking the pan occasionally, until the mussels begin to open, about 5 minutes.",
      "Transfer the opened mussels to serving bowls. Cook any mussels that remain closed a minute or two longer. Discard any that do not open. Pour the cooking liquid over the mussels. Serve hot."
