            "Place the mussels in cold water to cover for 30 minutes. Scrub them with a stiff brush and scrape off any barnacles or seaweed. Remove the beards by pulling them toward the narrow end of the shells. Discard any mussels with cracked shells or that do not shut tightly when tapped. Place the mussels in a large pot with 1/2 cup cold water. Cover the pot and bring to a simmer. Cook until the mussels open, about 5 minutes. With a slotted spoon, transfer the mussels to a bowl.",
            "Place the clams in the pot and cover the pan. Cook until the clams open, about 5 minutes. Remove the clams from the pot. Strain the liquid in the pot through a paper coffee filter into a bowl and reserve.",
            "With your fingers, remove the clams and mussels from the shells and place them in a bowl.",
            "Pour the oil into a large pot. Add the pancetta, onion, and garlic. Cook, stirring frequently, over medium heat until tender and golden, about 10 minutes.",
            "Add the beans, tomatoes, and calamari. Add the reserved juices from the shellfish. Bring to a simmer and cook for 20 minutes.",
            "Stir in the seafood and cook until just cooked through, about 5 minutes.",
            "Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the pasta and salt to taste. Cook until tender. Drain the pasta and add it to the soup. Add a little of the pasta liquid if the soup seems too thick.",
            "Stir in the parsley. Serve hot, drizzled with extra-virgin olive oil."
