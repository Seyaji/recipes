        "introduction": "Cavatelli with Arugula and Tomato is a delightful combination of nutty and spicy arugula paired with ripe, juicy tomatoes. The dish is finished with a sprinkle of grated ricotta salata or Pecorino Romano, making it a simple yet flavorful pasta that can be whipped up quickly.",
        "ingredients": [
            "1/4 cup olive oil",
            "2 garlic cloves, finely chopped",
            "2 pounds ripe plum tomatoes, peeled, seeded, and chopped, or 1 (28-ounce) can imported Italian peeled tomatoes with their juice",
            "Salt and freshly ground black pepper",
            "1 pound fresh or frozen cavatelli",
            "1/2 cup grated ricotta salata or Pecorino Romano",
            "1 large bunch of arugula, trimmed and torn into bite-size pieces (about 2 cups)"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "In a skillet large enough to hold all of the ingredients, cook the garlic in the oil over medium heat until lightly golden, about 2 minutes. Add the tomatoes and salt and pepper to taste. Bring the sauce to a simmer and cook until thickened, about 20 minutes.",
            "Bring at least 4 quarts of water to a boil. Add the pasta and salt to taste. Stir well. Cook over high heat, stirring frequently, until the pasta is tender. Drain the pasta, reserving some of the cooking water.",
            "Stir the pasta into the tomato sauce with half of the cheese. Add the arugula and stir well. Add a little of the reserved cooking water if the pasta seems too dry. Sprinkle with the remaining cheese and serve immediately."
