  "introduction": "Orecchiette with Pork Ragù is a delightful Italian dish originating from the region of Puglia. The orecchiette, meaning 'little ears' in Italian, are handmade pasta shells that perfectly cradle the rich and savory pork ragù. This combination delivers a hearty and comforting meal that beautifully showcases traditional Italian flavors and craftsmanship.",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 recipe Semolina Dough",
    "3 cups Pork Ragù with Fresh Herbs",
    "1/2 cup freshly grated Pecorino Romano"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "1. Prepare ragù and dough. Have ready 2 large baking sheets dusted with flour. Cut the dough into 1/2-inch pieces. Hold a small knife with a dull blade and rounded tip with your index finger pressed against the blade of the knife. Flatten each piece of dough with the tip of the knife, pressing and dragging it slightly so that the dough forms a disk. Invert each disk over the tip of your thumb creating a dome shape.",
    "2. Spread the pieces on the prepared pans. Repeat with the remaining dough. (If you are not using the orecchiette within 1 hour, place the pans in the freezer. When the pieces are firm, scoop them into a plastic bag and seal tightly. Do not thaw before cooking.)",
    "3. Bring at least 4 quarts of water to a boil. Add the pasta and salt to taste. Stir well. Cook over high heat, stirring frequently, until the pasta is al dente, tender yet still firm to the bite. Drain the pasta, reserving some of the cooking water.",
    "4. Add the pasta to the ragù. Add the cheese and stir well, adding some of the reserved cooking water, if the sauce seems too thick. Serve immediately."
