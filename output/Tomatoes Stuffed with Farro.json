  "titleAlternative": "Pomodori Ripieni",
  "yield": "Makes 4 servings",
  "introduction": "Farro, an ancient grain popular in Italy, pairs wonderfully with cheese and onion to create a satisfying stuffing inside ripe tomatoes. This delightful dish, reminiscent of something enjoyed at L'Angolo Divino—a quaint wine bar in Rome—is both delicious and hearty.",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 cup semipearled farro (or substitute wheat berries or bulgur)",
    "Salt",
    "4 large round tomatoes",
    "1 small onion, finely chopped",
    "2 tablespoons olive oil",
    "1/4 cup grated Pecorino Romano or Parmigiano-Reggiano",
    "Freshly ground black pepper"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "In a medium saucepan, bring 4 cups of water to a boil. Add the farro and salt to taste. Cook until the farro is tender but still chewy, about 30 minutes. Drain the farro and place it in a bowl.",
    "In a small saucepan, cook the onion in the oil over medium heat until golden, about 10 minutes.",
    "Place a rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Oil a small baking pan just large enough to hold the tomatoes.",
    "Rinse and dry the tomatoes. Cut a slice 1/2 inch thick from the top of each tomato and reserve. With a small spoon, scoop out the insides of the tomatoes and place the pulp in a fine-mesh strainer set over a bowl. Arrange the tomato shells in the baking dish.",
    "To the bowl with the farro, add the strained tomato liquid, sautéed onion, cheese, and salt and pepper to taste. Spoon the mixture into the tomato shells. Cover the tomatoes with the reserved tops.",
    "Bake 20 minutes or until the tomatoes are tender. Serve hot or at room temperature."
