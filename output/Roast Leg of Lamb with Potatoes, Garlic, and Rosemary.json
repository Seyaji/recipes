        "ingredients": [
            "6 all-purpose potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks",
            "3 tablespoons olive oil",
            "Salt and freshly ground black pepper",
            "1 bone-in leg of lamb, trimmed (about 5 1/2 pounds)",
            "6 garlic cloves, finely chopped",
            "2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "1. Place a rack in the middle of the oven. Preheat oven to 350°F. Place the potatoes in a roasting pan large enough to hold the meat and potatoes without crowding. Toss with the oil, and salt and pepper to taste.",
            "2. Make shallow slits all over the lamb with a small knife. Poke some of the garlic and rosemary into the slits, reserving a little for the potatoes. Sprinkle the meat generously with salt and pepper. Push the potatoes aside and add the meat fat-side up.",
            "3. Place the pan in the oven and cook 30 minutes. Turn the potatoes. Roast 30 to 45 minutes longer or until the internal temperature measures 130°F on an instant-read thermometer placed in the thickest part of the meat, away from the bone. Remove the pan from the oven and transfer the lamb to a cutting board. Cover the meat with foil. Let rest at least 15 minutes before slicing.",
            "4. Test the potatoes for doneness by piercing them with a sharp knife. If they need further cooking, turn the oven up to 400°F, return the pan to the oven, and cook until tender.",
            "5. Slice the lamb and serve hot with the potatoes."
