    "introduction": "The mild licorice flavor of the fennel, the tang of the lemon, and the fresh taste of the parsley balance wonderfully in this salad. It would be a perfect first course for a seafood meal, or serve it for a buffet dinner. The crisp fennel holds up well without wilting. For really thinly sliced fennel, use a mandoline slicer or food processor.",
    "ingredients": [
      "2 medium fennel bulbs, trimmed",
      "2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley",
      "3 tablespoons olive oil",
      "1 to 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice",
      "A small wedge of Parmigiano-Reggiano"
