  "introduction": "Eggplant Caviar is a delightful and creamy dip made without the high-fat ingredients you typically find in other dips. This delicious spread derives its smooth texture from roasted eggplant, enriched with the flavors of portobello mushroom, pine nuts, and garlic, with a touch of extra-virgin olive oil to enhance its taste.",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 large portobello mushroom, wiped or lightly rinsed and stemmed",
    "1 large eggplant, about 1 pound",

    "2 tablespoons olive oil",
    "Salt and freshly ground black pepper",
    "Toasted Italian or French bread or raw vegetables"

    "1. Place a rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 450Â°F. Line a small baking pan with foil.",
    "2. Brush the mushroom lightly with oil. Place the mushroom and the eggplant in the pan. Pierce the eggplant skin in several places with a fork. Bake 20 minutes or until the mushroom is tender when pierced with a fork. Remove the mushroom. Turn the eggplant and cook 20 minutes more or until tender when pierced with a knife.",
