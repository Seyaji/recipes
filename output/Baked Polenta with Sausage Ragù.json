        "introduction": "Baked Polenta with Sausage Ragù, also known as Polenta Pasticciato, is a delectable dish that layers thick, creamy polenta with rich sausage ragù and two types of cheese. Similar to a lasagne, the polenta takes the place of pasta, giving this dish a unique and hearty twist on a classic Italian favorite.",
        "ingredients": [
            "1 recipe Sausage Ragù",
            "8 cups cold water",
            "2 cups coarsely ground yellow cornmeal, preferably stone-ground",
            "1 tablespoon salt",
            "8 ounces fresh mozzarella",
            "1/2 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Prepare the ragù, if necessary. In a large saucepan, bring 6 cups of the water to a boil.",
            "In a medium bowl, stir together the cornmeal, salt, and remaining 2 cups of water.",
            "Pour the cornmeal mixture into the boiling water, stirring constantly, until the mixture comes to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook, stirring occasionally, about 30 minutes or until the polenta is thick and creamy.",
            "Butter a large baking sheet. Pour the polenta into the pan and spread it evenly with a rubber spatula to a 1/2-inch thickness. Let cool until firm, about least 1 hour, or cover and refrigerate overnight.",
            "Place a rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 400°F. Oil a 9-inch square baking dish.",
            "Cut the polenta into 9 3-inch squares. Arrange half the polenta in the bottom of the dish. Spoon on half the sauce and top with half the mozzarella and Parmigiano-Reggiano. Make a second layer of the remaining ingredients.",
            "Bake 40 minutes or until the polenta is bubbling and the cheese is melted. Let stand 10 minutes before serving."
