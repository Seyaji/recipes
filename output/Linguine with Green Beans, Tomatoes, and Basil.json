    "ingredients": [
      "12 ounces green beans, trimmed",
      "Salt",
      "1/4 cup olive oil",
      "1 garlic clove, finely chopped",
      "5 medium tomatoes, peeled, seeded, and chopped (about 3 cups)",
      "Freshly ground black pepper",
      "1 pound linguine",
      "1/2 cup chopped fresh basil",
      "1 cup grated ricotta salata, mild feta, or fresh ricotta"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Bring about 4 quarts of water to a boil. Add the green beans and salt to taste. Cook 5 minutes or until crisp-tender. Scoop out the green beans with a slotted spoon or strainer, reserving the water. Pat the beans dry. Cut the beans into 1-inch lengths.",
      "Pour the oil into a skillet large enough to hold the cooked pasta. Add the garlic and cook over medium-low heat until lightly golden, about 2 minutes.",
      "Add the tomatoes and salt and pepper to taste. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes thicken and the juices evaporate. Stir in the beans. Simmer 5 minutes more.",
      "Meanwhile, bring the pot of water back to a boil. Add 2 tablespoons of salt, then the linguine, gently pushing it down until the pasta is completely covered with water. Cook over high heat, stirring frequently, until the pasta is al dente, tender yet still firm to the bite. Set aside some of the cooking water. Drain the pasta and add it to the skillet with the sauce.",
      "Toss the linguine with the sauce in the skillet. Add the basil and cheese and toss again over medium heat until the cheese is creamy. Serve immediately."
