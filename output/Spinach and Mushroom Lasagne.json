  "introduction": "Lasagne brings comfort to the table with its layers of tender pasta, creamy béchamel, earthy spinach, and hearty mushrooms. Inspired by a delightful dish from Parma, this Spinach and Mushroom Lasagne is a heartwarming meal that promises to be a family favorite.",
  "ingredients": [
    "3 cups Béchamel Sauce",
    "1 pound fresh spinach, trimmed",
    "Salt",
    "5 tablespoons unsalted butter",
    "1 small onion, finely chopped",
    "1.5 pounds button mushrooms, chopped",
    "1 pound fresh lasagne",
    "1.5 cups freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Prepare the béchamel sauce. Then, place the spinach in a large pot with 1/2 cup of water. Add a pinch of salt. Cover and cook over medium heat until the spinach is tender, about 5 minutes. Drain the spinach well. Let cool. Wrap the spinach in a towel and squeeze it to extract as much of the juice as possible. Chop the spinach and set it aside.",
    "In a large skillet, melt four tablespoons of the butter over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes.",
    "Stir in the mushrooms and salt and pepper to taste. Cook, stirring frequently, until all of the liquid evaporates and the mushrooms are tender. Stir in the chopped cooked spinach.",
    "Set aside 1/2 cup of the béchamel sauce. Stir the remainder into the vegetable mixture.",
    "Have ready a large bowl of cold water. Lay out some lint-free kitchen towels on a work surface.",
    "Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add 2 tablespoons of salt. Add the lasagne a few pieces at a time. Cook the lasagne until tender but slightly underdone. Scoop the pasta out of the water. Place the cooked pasta in the cold water. When cool enough to handle, lay the pasta sheets out flat on the towels, which can be stacked one on top of the other. Continue cooking and cooling the remaining lasagne in the same way.",
    "Butter a 13 × 9 × 2–inch pan. Set aside the 2 best-looking pasta strips for the top layer. Make a layer of pasta in the prepared pan, overlapping the pieces. Spread with a thin layer of the vegetables and a sprinkle of cheese. Repeat the layering, ending with the pasta. Spread with reserved béchamel. Sprinkle with the remaining cheese. Dot with the remaining butter.",
    "Preheat the oven to 375°F. Bake 45 minutes. If the lasagne is browning too much, cover it loosely with foil. Bake 15 minutes more or until the top is browned and the sauce is bubbling around the edge. Remove from the oven and let stand 15 minutes before serving. Cut into squares to serve."
