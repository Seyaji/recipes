  "introduction": "In this delightful dish from Puglia, the vibrant colors of the Italian flag come alive in a harmonious blend of red tomatoes, white potatoes, and green arugula. Known locally as 'the flag,' this pasta can also be enjoyed as a comforting soup with more liquid. The flavors are intensified with the addition of garlic, basil, and a hint of crushed red pepper, making each bite a celebration of Italian cuisine.",
  "ingredients": [
    "1/4 cup olive oil",
    "2 large garlic cloves, finely chopped",
    "Pinch of crushed red pepper",
    "1 1/2 pounds ripe plum tomatoes, peeled, seeded, and chopped (about 3 cups)",
    "2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil",
    "Salt and freshly ground black pepper",
    "1 pound elbows",
    "3 medium boiling potatoes (1 pound), peeled and cut into 1/2-inch pieces",
    "2 bunches arugula, trimmed and cut into 1-inch lengths (about 4 cups)",
    "1/3 cup freshly grated Pecorino Romano"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Pour the oil into a skillet large enough to hold the pasta. Add the garlic and crushed red pepper. Cook over medium heat until the garlic is golden, 2 minutes.",
    "Add the tomatoes, basil, and salt and pepper to taste. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is thickened slightly, about 10 minutes.",
    "Bring at least 4 quarts of water to a boil in a large pot. Add 2 tablespoons of salt, then the pasta. Stir well. When the water returns to the boil, stir in the potatoes. Cook, stirring frequently, until the pasta is al dente, tender yet firm to the bite.",
    "Drain the pasta and potatoes, reserving some of the cooking water. Stir the pasta, potatoes, and arugula into the simmering tomato sauce. Cook, stirring, 1 to 2 minutes or until the pasta and vegetables are well coated with the sauce. Add some of the reserved cooking water if the pasta seems dry.",
    "Stir in the cheese and serve immediately."
