            "Set aside 1/3 cup of the sugar.",
            "In the large bowl of an electric mixer, beat the butter with the remaining 2/3 cup of sugar at medium speed until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Beat in the egg yolks one at a time. Add the lemon and orange zests and vanilla extract and beat, scraping the sides of the bowl, until smooth, about 2 minutes more.",

            "Preheat the oven to 325Â°F. Grease 2 large baking sheets. Cut the dough into 6 pieces. Divide each piece again into 6 pieces. Roll each piece into a 4-inch rope, shape into a ring, and pinch the ends together to seal. Place the rings 1 inch apart on the prepared baking sheets. Brush lightly with the egg white and sprinkle with the reserved 1/3 cup of sugar.",
            "Bake 15 minutes or until lightly browned. Have ready 2 wire cooling racks.",
