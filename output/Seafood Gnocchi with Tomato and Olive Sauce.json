  "introduction": "Seafood Gnocchi with Tomato and Olive Sauce is a delightful Sicilian dish featuring potato gnocchi infused with delicate fish, and served with a slightly spicy tomato and olive sauce. This dish is sumptuous and does not require cheese, as the combination of fresh ingredients creates a perfect harmony of flavors.",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 pound baking potatoes",

    "1 garlic clove",
    "12 ounces fillet of sole or another delicate white fish, cut into 2-inch pieces",
    "1/2 cup dry white wine",
    "Salt and freshly ground black pepper",
    "1 large egg, beaten",
    "About 2 cups all-purpose flour",
    "For the sauce:",

  "instructions": [
    "1. Place the potatoes in a pot with cold water to cover. Bring to a simmer and cook until very tender when pierced with a knife. Drain and let cool.",
    "2. In a medium skillet, cook the onion and garlic in the olive oil for 5 minutes over medium heat until the onion is tender. Add the fish and cook for 1 minute. Add the wine, and salt and pepper to taste. Cook until the fish is tender and the liquid is mostly evaporated, about 5 minutes. Let cool, then scrape the contents of the skillet into a food processor or blender. Puree until smooth.",
    "3. Line large pans with foil or plastic wrap. Pass the potatoes through a ricer or food mill into a large bowl. Add the fish puree and the egg. Gradually add the flour and salt to taste to form a slightly sticky dough. Knead briefly until smooth and well blended.",
    "4. Divide the dough into 6 pieces. Keeping the remaining dough covered, roll one piece into a long rope about 3/4 inch thick. Cut the rope into 1/2-inch long nuggets.",
    "5. To shape the dough, hold a fork in one hand with the tines pointed down. With the thumb of the other hand, roll each piece of dough over the back of the tines, pressing lightly to make ridges on one side and an indentation on the other. Let the gnocchi drop onto the prepared pans. The pieces should not touch. Repeat with the remaining dough.",
    "6. Refrigerate the gnocchi until ready to cook. (Gnocchi can also be frozen. Place the baking sheets in the freezer for one hour or until firm. Put the gnocchi in a large heavy-duty plastic bag. Freeze up to 1 month. Do not thaw before cooking.)",
    "7. For the sauce, combine the oil with the scallion in a large skillet. Add the anchovy fillets and cook until the anchovies are dissolved, about 2 minutes. Stir in the olive paste, tomatoes, and parsley. Add salt and pepper and cook until the tomato juices have thickened slightly, 8 to 10 minutes. Spoon half the sauce into a large warm serving bowl.",
    "8. Prepare the gnocchi: Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add salt to taste. Lower the heat so that the water boils gently. Drop about half of the gnocchi into the water. Cook for about 30 seconds after the gnocchi rise to the surface. Skim the gnocchi from the pot with a slotted spoon, draining the pieces well. Place the gnocchi in the serving bowl. Cook the remaining gnocchi in the same way. Add the remaining sauce and stir gently. Serve immediately."

  "variations": [
    "For a milder flavor, you can replace the black olive paste with green olive paste.",
    "If you prefer a different sauce, a butter and herb sauce can be substituted for the tomato and olive sauce."
