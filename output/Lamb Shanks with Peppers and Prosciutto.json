  "ingredients": [
    "4 tablespoons olive oil",
    "6 small lamb shanks, well trimmed",
    "Salt and freshly ground black pepper",
    "1/2 cup dry white wine",
    "2-inch sprig fresh rosemary, or 1/2 teaspoon dried",
    "1 1/2 cups Meat Broth",
    "2 red bell peppers, cut into 1/2-inch strips",

    "1 tablespoon unsalted butter",
    "2 ounces sliced imported Italian prosciutto, cut into thin strips",
    "2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "In a Dutch oven just large enough to hold the lamb shanks in a single layer, or another deep, heavy pot with a tight-fitting lid, heat the oil over medium heat. Pat the lamb shanks dry. Brown them well on all sides, turning the pieces with tongs, about 15 minutes. Tip the pan and spoon off the excess fat. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.",
    "Add the wine and cook, scraping up and blending in the browned bits at the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Bring to a simmer and cook 1 minute.",
    "Add the rosemary and broth and bring the liquid to a simmer.",
    "Partially cover the pan. Reduce heat to low. Cook, turning the meat occasionally, until the lamb is very tender when pierced with a fork, about 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours.",
    "While the lamb is cooking, in a medium saucepan, combine the peppers, butter, and 2 tablespoons of water over medium heat. Cover and cook 10 minutes, or until the vegetables are almost tender.",
    "Add the softened peppers and the prosciutto to the lamb along with the parsley. Cook uncovered over medium heat until the peppers are tender, about 5 minutes.",
    "With a slotted spoon, transfer the shanks and peppers to the warmed platter. Cover and keep warm. If the liquid left in the pan is too thin, raise the heat to high and boil until reduced and slightly thickened. Taste and adjust the seasoning. Pour the sauce over the lamb and serve immediately."
