    "introduction": "Baked onions, or Cipolle al Forno, is a delightful dish where onions turn smooth and sweet when cooked. Perfectly paired with roast beef, these onions are topped with a savory mixture of bread crumbs, cheese, and olive oil and baked until tender and golden.",
    "ingredients": [
      "4 medium white or red onions, peeled",
      "1/2 cup plain dry bread crumbs",
      "1/4 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano or Pecorino Romano",
      "2 tablespoons olive oil",
      "Salt and freshly ground black pepper"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil. Add the onions and reduce the heat so that the water just simmers. Cook for 5 minutes. Let the onions cool in the water in the pan. Drain the onions and cut them in half crosswise.",
      "Place a rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Oil a baking pan just large enough to hold the onions in a single layer. Place the onions in the pan cut-side up. In a small bowl, mix together the bread crumbs, cheese, olive oil, and salt and pepper to taste. Spoon the bread crumbs on top of the onions.",
      "Bake for 1 hour or until the onions are golden and tender when pierced with a knife. Serve hot or at room temperature."
