        "ingredients": [
            "2 or 3 Italian-style pork sausages (about 12 ounces)",
            "2 tablespoons olive oil",
            "1 medium onion, finely chopped",
            "2 garlic cloves, finely chopped",
            "4 tablespoons tomato paste",
            "2 cups water",
            "2 cups cooked dried cranberry or cannellini beans, lightly drained",
            "Salt and freshly ground black pepper",
            "1 pound rigatoni",
            "1 tablespoon unsalted butter",
            "1/4 cup finely chopped fresh basil",
            "1/2 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Remove the casings from the sausages and finely chop the meat.",
            "Pour the oil into a saucepan large enough to hold all of the ingredients. Add the onion, sausage meat, and garlic. Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the onions are tender and the sausage is lightly browned, about 15 minutes.",
            "Add the tomato paste and water. Bring to a simmer and cook 20 minutes or until slightly thickened.",
            "Add the beans and salt and pepper to taste. Cook 10 minutes, mashing some of the beans with the back of a spoon to make the sauce creamy.",
            "Bring at least 4 quarts of water to a boil in a large pot. Add 2 tablespoons of salt, then the pasta. Stir well. Cook over high heat, stirring frequently, until the pasta is al dente, tender yet still firm to the bite. Set aside some of the cooking water. Drain the pasta.",
            "Add the pasta to the pan with the sauce, toss together, and cook 1 minute, adding a little of the water if needed. Stir in the butter and basil. Add the cheese and toss again. Serve immediately."
