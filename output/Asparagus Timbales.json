        "introduction": "Silky smooth custards like these are a delightful Italian culinary creation. Versatile and delicious, almost any vegetable can be transformed into these delectable molds, making them a perfect side dish, first course, or vegetarian main dish. The little unmolded wonders, or sformatini, can be enjoyed plain, adorned with a tomato or cheese sauce, or paired with buttery sautéed vegetables.",
        "ingredients": [
            "1 cup Béchamel Sauce",
            "1.5 pounds asparagus, trimmed",
            "3 large eggs",
            "1/4 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano",
            "Salt and freshly ground black pepper"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Prepare the béchamel if necessary. Bring about 2 inches of water to a boil in a large skillet. Add the asparagus and salt to taste. Cook until the asparagus bend slightly when you lift them by the stem end, 4 to 8 minutes. Cooking time will depend on the thickness of the asparagus. Remove the asparagus with tongs. Drain them on paper towels and pat them dry. Cut off and set aside 6 of the tips.",
            "Place the asparagus in a food processor and process until smooth. Blend in the eggs, béchamel, cheese, 1 teaspoon salt, and pepper to taste.",
            "Place a rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Generously butter six 6-ounce ramekins or custard cups. Pour the asparagus mixture into the cups. Place the cups in a large roasting pan and pour boiling water into the pan to reach halfway up the sides of the cups.",
            "Bake 50 to 60 minutes or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean. Remove the molds from the pan and run a small knife around the edge. Invert the molds onto serving dishes. Top with the reserved asparagus tips and serve hot."
