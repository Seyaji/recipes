  "introduction": "Green Gnocchi in Pink Sauce offers a delightful twist on traditional gnocchi. Originating from Emilia-Romagna and Tuscany, these gnocchi are lighter than their potato counterparts. The presence of spinach and Swiss chard not only adds to their nutritional value but also gives them a unique texture.",
  "ingredients": [
    "3 cups Pink Sauce",
    "1 pound spinach, stems removed",
    "1 pound Swiss chard, stems removed",
    "1/4 cup water",
    "Salt",
    "2 tablespoons unsalted butter",
    "1/4 cup finely chopped onion",
    "1 pound whole or part-skim ricotta",
    "2 large eggs",
    "1 1/2 cups freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano",
    "1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg",
    "Freshly ground black pepper",
    "1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Prepare the sauce. In a large pot, combine the two greens, water, and salt to taste. Cook for 5 minutes or until wilted and tender. Drain and let cool. Wrap the greens in a towel and squeeze to extract the liquid. Chop finely.",
    "In a medium skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring frequently, until golden, about 10 minutes.",
    "In a large bowl, beat together the ricotta, eggs, 1 cup of the Parmigiano-Reggiano, nutmeg, and salt and pepper to taste. Add the onion and chopped greens and mix well. Stir in the flour until well blended. The dough will be soft.",
    "Line baking sheets with parchment or wax paper. Dampen your hands with cool water. Scoop up a tablespoonful of the dough and lightly shape it into a 3/4-inch ball. Place the ball on a baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining dough. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to cook.",
    "Bring at least 4 quarts of water to a boil. Add salt to taste. Lower the heat slightly. Add half the gnocchi a few at a time. When they rise to the surface, cook for 30 seconds longer.",
    "Spoon half the hot sauce into a warm serving platter. Remove the gnocchi with a slotted spoon and drain them well. Add them to the platter. Cover and keep warm while you cook the remaining gnocchi in the same way. Spoon on the remaining sauce and cheese. Serve hot."
