  "introduction": "Duck Ragù, also known as Ragù di Anatra, hails from the Veneto region where wild ducks flourish in aquatic environments. This rich, gamy sauce pairs wonderfully with pasta such as fettuccine or bigoli and makes for a compelling dish prepared using domesticated ducks.",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 duckling (about 5 1⁄2 pounds)",
    "2 tablespoons olive oil",
    "Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste",
    "2 ounces pancetta, chopped",
    "2 medium onions, chopped",
    "2 medium carrots, chopped",
    "2 celery ribs, chopped",
    "6 fresh sage leaves",
    "Pinch of freshly grated nutmeg",
    "1 cup dry white wine",
    "2 1⁄2 cups peeled, seeded, and chopped fresh tomatoes"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "1. Rinse the duck inside and out and remove any loose fat from the cavity. Using poultry shears, cut the duck into 8 pieces. First cut the duck along the backbone. Open the duck like a book. With a heavy knife, cut the duck in half lengthwise between the two sides of the breast. Cut the thigh away from breast. Separate the leg and thigh at the joint. Separate the wing and breast at the joint. If using the liver, cut it into dice and set aside.",
    "2. In a large heavy saucepan, heat the oil over medium heat. Pat the duck pieces dry with paper towels. Add the duck pieces and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned on all sides. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Remove the duck to a platter. Spoon off all but 2 tablespoons of the fat.",
    "3. Add the pancetta, onions, carrots, celery, and sage to the pan. Cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are tender and golden. Add the wine and simmer for 1 minute.",
    "4. Return the duck to the pot and add the tomatoes and water. Bring the liquid to a simmer. Partially cover the pot and cook, stirring occasionally, for 2 hours, or until the duck is very tender when pierced with a fork. Stir in the duck liver, if using. Remove the pan from the heat. Let cool slightly, then skim the fat from the surface. Remove the pieces of meat from the sauce with a slotted spoon and transfer to a platter. Cover to keep warm.",
    "5. Serve the sauce with hot cooked fettuccine, followed by the duck meat as a second course. The entire dish can be cooked ahead of time up to 2 days in advance, stored in an airtight container and refrigerated."
