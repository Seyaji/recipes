  "introduction": "Roasted Potatoes with Garlic and Rosemary are a classic, irresistibly delicious side dish that boasts a perfect balance of crispy, golden-brown exteriors and fluffy, flavorful interiors. The addition of rosemary and garlic infuses these potatoes with aromatic and savory notes that elevate their flavor profile. The key to achieving this delectable dish is to ensure that the potato pieces are evenly spread out in the pan, preventing them from overcrowding and steaming instead of roasting.",
  "ingredients": [
    "2 pounds all-purpose potatoes, such as Yukon gold",
    "1/4 cup olive oil",
    "1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary",
    "Salt and freshly ground black pepper",
    "2 garlic cloves, finely chopped"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "1. Place a rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Scrub the potatoes with a brush under cold running water. Peel them if desired. Cut the potatoes into 1-inch pieces. Dry the potatoes with paper towels. Put them in a roasting pan large enough to hold the potatoes in a single layer. Drizzle with the oil and toss with the rosemary and salt and pepper to taste. Spread the potatoes out evenly.",
    "2. Roast the potatoes, stirring every 15 minutes, for 45 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook 15 minutes more or until the potatoes are tender. Serve hot."
