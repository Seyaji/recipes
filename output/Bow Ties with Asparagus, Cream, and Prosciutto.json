  "introduction": "Perfect for a spring menu, this rich and flavorful pasta dish combines tender asparagus, creamy sauce, and thin strips of Italian prosciutto. It is an excellent first course before a simple grilled meat like veal or chicken. For an added twist, try incorporating chopped roasted peppers.",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 pound fresh asparagus, trimmed",
    "Salt",
    "1 cup heavy cream",
    "1 pound farfalle",
    "1/2 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano",
    "2 ounces sliced imported Italian prosciutto, cut crosswise into thin strips"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "In a large skillet, bring about 2 inches of water to a boil. Add the asparagus and salt to taste. Cook until the asparagus are just tender and bend slightly when lifted from the water. The cooking time will depend on the thickness of the asparagus. Pat the asparagus dry. Cut them into bite-size pieces.",
    "Bring the cream to a simmer in a small saucepan. Cook 5 minutes or until slightly thickened.",
    "Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add 2 tablespoons of salt, then the pasta. Stir well. Cook over high heat, stirring frequently, until the pasta is al dente, tender yet still firm to the bite. Set aside some of the cooking water. Drain the pasta.",
    "Pour the pasta, cream, and cheese into a large serving bowl and toss well. Add a little cooking water if the sauce seems too thick. Add the asparagus and prosciutto and toss again. Serve immediately."
