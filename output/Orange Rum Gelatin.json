  "introduction": "Orange Rum Gelatin is a delightful dessert that combines the bright, refreshing flavor of fresh orange juice with the warming touch of dark rum. This smooth and vibrant gelatin is beautifully complemented by a garnish of fresh orange slices. It pairs nicely with rum-scented whipped cream, enhancing its citrusy notes. Blood orange juice works best in this recipe, adding an extra depth of flavor.",
  "ingredients": [
    "2 envelopes unflavored gelatin",
    "1/2 cup sugar",
    "1/2 cup cold water",
    "3 cups fresh orange juice",
    "2 tablespoons dark rum",
    "Orange slices, for garnish"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "In a medium saucepan, stir together the gelatin and sugar. Add the water and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the gelatin is completely dissolved, about 3 minutes. (Do not allow the mixture to boil.)",
    "Remove from the heat and stir in orange juice and rum. Pour mixture into a 5-cup mold or bowl. Cover and chill until set, 4 hours up to overnight.",
    "When ready to serve, fill a bowl with warm water and dip the mold into the water for 30 seconds. Run a small knife around the sides. Lay a plate over the mold, and holding them together, invert them both so that the gelatin transfers to the plate. Garnish with the orange slices."
