    "introduction": "If you have never had fresh beets in season, you really should try them. When they are young and tender, they are remarkably sweet and flavorful. Buy them in the summer and fall, when they are at their best. As they age they become woody and tasteless.",
    "ingredients": [
      "6 beets, trimmed and scrubbed",
      "2 large onions, peeled",
      "6 tablespoons olive oil",
      "2 tablespoons red wine vinegar",
      "Salt and freshly ground black pepper",
      "6 fresh basil leaves"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Place a rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Scrub the beets and wrap them in a large sheet of aluminum foil, sealing tightly. Place the package on a baking sheet.",
      "Cut the onions into bite-size pieces. Place them in a baking pan and toss with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil.",
      "Place the package of beets and the pan of onions side by side in the oven. Bake 1 hour or until the beets are tender when pierced with a knife and the onions are browned.",
      "Let the beets cool. Peel off the skins and cut the beets into wedges.",
      "In a large bowl, toss the beets and onions with 1/4 cup olive oil, the vinegar, and salt and pepper to taste. Sprinkle with the basil and serve immediately."
