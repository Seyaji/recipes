  "title": "Truffled Meat Rag첫",
  "titleAlternative": "Rag첫 Tartufato",
  "yield": "Makes 5 cups",
  "introduction": "This luxurious Umbrian rag첫 showcases the unique, earthy flavor of black truffles, which are added at the end of the cooking process to maintain their distinctive character. While fresh truffles are ideal, jarred truffles or truffle oil can also be used to infuse the sauce with their aromatic depth. Paired with fresh fettuccine, this rich sauce is so flavorful that grated cheese becomes unnecessary.",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 ounce dried porcini mushrooms",
    "2 cups hot water",
    "2 tablespoons unsalted butter",
    "8 ounces ground pork",
    "8 ounces ground veal",
    "2 ounces sliced pancetta, chopped fine",
    "1 celery rib, cut in half",
    "1 medium carrot, cut in half",
    "1 small onion, peeled but left whole",
    "2 medium-size fresh tomatoes, peeled, seeded, and chopped, or 1 cup imported Italian canned tomatoes, drained and chopped",
    "1 tablespoon tomato paste",
    "1/4 cup heavy cream",
    "1 small black fresh or jarred truffle, thinly sliced, or a few drops of truffle oil",
    "Pinch of freshly grated nutmeg"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Place the porcini mushrooms in a bowl with the water. Let soak 30 minutes. Lift the mushrooms out of the liquid. Strain the liquid through a coffee filter or dampened cheesecloth into a clean bowl and set aside. Wash the mushrooms well under cool water, paying special attention to the base of the stems where soil collects. Finely chop the mushrooms.",
    "In a large saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the meats and cook, stirring to break up lumps, until the meat loses its pink color but does not brown. It should remain soft.",
    "Add the wine and simmer 1 minute. Add the celery, carrot, onion, and mushrooms and 1 cup of their liquid, the tomatoes, and tomato paste and stir well. Let cook over very low heat for 1 hour. If the sauce becomes too dry, add a little of the mushroom liquid.",
    "When the rag첫 has cooked for 1 hour, remove the celery, carrot, and onion. The sauce can be prepared ahead to this point. Let it cool, then store in an airtight container and refrigerate up to 3 days or store in the freezer up to 2 months. Reheat the sauce before proceeding.",
    "Just before serving, add the cream, truffle, and nutmeg to the hot sauce. Stir gently but do not cook, to preserve the flavor of the truffle. Serve hot."
