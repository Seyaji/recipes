    "introduction": "Broccoli Toasts feature the delicate and unique flavor of Roman broccoli, or broccoli romanesco, which resembles an exotic seashell. This pale green vegetable brings a mild, delicious taste, similar to a cross between broccoli and cauliflower. In this recipe, it's pureed with garlic and olive oil to create a delightful spread for toasted Italian bread, perfect for a savory appetizer or snack.",
    "ingredients": [
      "1 pound broccoli",
      "Salt",
      "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil",
      "1 whole garlic clove",
      "Freshly ground black pepper",
      "8 (1/2-inch-thick) slices Italian bread"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Trim the broccoli, reserving some of the stems. Bring a large saucepan of water to boiling. Add the broccoli and salt to taste. Cook until the broccoli is tender, about 10 minutes. Drain well, reserving some of the water.",
      "Transfer the broccoli to a food processor. Add the garlic and process until chopped fine. With the motor running, add the oil through the tube and process until smooth and spreadable. Add a tablespoon or two of the broccoli water if the mixture is too thick. Season with salt and pepper to taste.",
      "Place a barbecue grill or broiler rack about 5 inches away from the heat source. Preheat the grill or broiler. Toast the bread on one side until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Turn the bread and toast the other side, about 2 minutes. Spread with the warm broccoli puree. Serve immediately."
