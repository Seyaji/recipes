    "introduction": "Tomato Sauce, Tuscan Style is a rich and flavorful Italian classic. The soffritto—a harmonious blend of onion, carrot, celery, and garlic cooked gently in olive oil—creates an aromatic base that enhances this robust sauce. Combining fresh plum tomatoes or high-quality imported canned tomatoes with a touch of chicken broth and a hint of crushed red pepper, this sauce achieves a perfect balance of savory depth and a gentle kick of heat. Finished with fragrant basil leaves, it embodies the essence of Tuscan cooking.",
