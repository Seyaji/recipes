    "introduction": "With luscious ripe tomatoes and rich, flavorful avocados, this salad is a burst of freshness and flavor. Inspired by a dish enjoyed in Milan, the sharp, slightly smoky imported provolone perfectly complements the smoothness of the avocado. Though tarragon isn't traditionally Italian, it adds a unique twist to this contemporary recipe. Feel free to substitute basil or parsley if preferred.",
    "ingredients": [
      "1 medium head Boston or leaf lettuce",
      "1/4 cup olive oil",
      "2 tablespoons lemon juice",
      "1 teaspoon Dijon mustard",
      "Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste",
      "6 basil leaves, torn into bits",
      "1 tablespoon chopped fresh tarragon",
      "2 small ripe avocados, peeled and sliced",
      "4 ounces imported provolone, sliced",
      "2 medium tomatoes, sliced"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Trim the lettuce, discarding the outer leaves and any that are bruised. Wash it in several changes of cool water. Dry very well. Tear the lettuce into bite-size pieces. There should be about 8 cups.",
      "In a small bowl, whisk together the oil, lemon juice, mustard, and salt and pepper to taste.",
      "In a deep platter, toss together the lettuce, basil, and tarragon. Add half of the dressing and toss well.",
      "Arrange the avocado, provolone, and tomato slices alternately on top. Drizzle with the remaining dressing and serve immediately."
