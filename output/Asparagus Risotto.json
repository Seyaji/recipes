    "introduction": "Discover the delightful flavors of Asparagus Risotto, a classic dish from the Veneto region, renowned for its delicate lavender-tipped white asparagus. Whether using white or green asparagus, this risotto promises a rich and creamy texture balanced with the tender taste of fresh asparagus.",
    "ingredients": [
      "5 cups Chicken Broth",
      "1 pound fresh asparagus, trimmed",
      "4 tablespoons unsalted butter",
      "1 small onion, finely chopped",
      "2 cups medium-grain rice (such as Arborio, Carnaroli, or Vialone Nano)",
      "1/2 cup dry white wine",
      "Salt and freshly ground black pepper",
      "3/4 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Prepare the broth if necessary. Bring the broth to a simmer over medium heat, then lower the heat so that it just keeps the broth hot. Cut off the asparagus tips and set them aside. Cut the stems into 1/2-inch slices.",
      "Melt 3 tablespoons of the butter in a wide, heavy saucepan. Add the onion and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until very tender and golden, about 10 minutes.",
      "Stir in the asparagus stems. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes.",
      "Add the rice and cook, stirring with a wooden spoon until hot, about 2 minutes. Add the wine and cook, stirring constantly, until the liquid evaporates. Pour 1/2 cup of the broth over the rice. Cook, stirring, until most of the liquid is absorbed.",
      "Continue adding broth about 1/2 cup at a time, stirring after each addition. Adjust the heat so that the liquid simmers rapidly but the rice does not stick to the pan. After about 10 minutes, stir in the asparagus tips. Season with salt and pepper. Continue adding broth as needed until the rice becomes tender yet firm to the bite and the risotto is creamy. When you think it may be done, taste a few grains. If not ready, test again in a minute or so. If the broth runs out before the rice is tender, use hot water. Cooking time will be 18 to 20 minutes.",
      "Remove the risotto pan from the heat. Stir in the cheese and the remaining tablespoon butter. Taste for seasoning. Serve immediately."
