  "introduction": "Artichokes, Jewish Style, are a beloved recipe originating from the Jewish Quarter of Rome where Jewish culinary traditions thrived. These crispy, fried artichokes are a delightful and savory snack known for their delightful crunch, much like potato chips, making them an indulgent treat that remains a staple in Roman cuisine.",
  "ingredients": [
    "4 medium artichokes, prepared as for stuffing",
    "Olive oil",
    "Salt"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Pat the artichokes dry. Place an artichoke with the bottom up on a flat surface. With the heel of your hand, press down on the artichoke to flatten it and spread the leaves open. Repeat with the remaining artichokes. Turn them so the leaf tips face up.",
    "In a large deep skillet or wide heavy saucepan, heat about 2 inches of the olive oil over medium heat until an artichoke leaf slipped into the oil sizzles and browns quickly. Protect your hand with an oven mitt, as the oil can spit and spatter if the artichokes are moist. Add the artichokes with leaf tips down. Cook, pressing the artichokes down into the oil with a slotted spoon until browned on one side, about 10 minutes. With tongs, carefully turn the artichokes and cook until browned, about 10 minutes more.",
    "Drain on paper towels. Sprinkle with salt and serve immediately."
