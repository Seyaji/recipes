  "ingredients": [
    "4 tablespoons unsalted butter",
    "1/4 cup finely chopped onion",
    "1 pound plum tomatoes, peeled and seeded and cut into 1/2-inch strips",
    "6 fresh basil leaves",
    "Salt to taste",
    "1 pound fresh fettuccine",
    "Freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano"

  "instructions": [
    "In a large skillet, heat 3 tablespoons of the butter over medium-low heat until melted. Add the onion and cook until golden, about 10 minutes.",
    "Stir in the tomato fillets, basil leaves, and a couple of pinches of salt. Cook until the tomatoes are tender, about 5 to 10 minutes.",
    "Bring at least 4 quarts of water to a boil. Add 2 tablespoons of salt, then the pasta. Stir well. Cook over high heat, stirring frequently, until the pasta is al dente, tender yet still firm to the bite. Drain the pasta, reserving some of the cooking water.",
