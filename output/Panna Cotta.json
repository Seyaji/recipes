        "introduction": "Panna Cotta is a classic Italian dessert that embodies elegance and simplicity. Translated as 'cooked cream', this dessert requires minimal cooking and offers a velvety texture and refined taste. Pair it with a fresh berry sauce, warm chocolate sauce, or fresh fruit to elevate your dining experience.",
        "ingredients": [
            "1 envelope unflavored gelatin",
            "1 1/2 cups whole milk",
            "1 1/2 cups heavy or whipping cream",
            "1 vanilla bean or 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract",
            "1 (2-inch) strip lemon zest",
            "1/4 cup sugar",
            "Fresh Strawberry Sauce"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Sprinkle the gelatin over the milk and let stand 2 minutes until the gelatin absorbs some of the liquid and softens.",
            "In a medium saucepan, combine the cream, vanilla bean (if using vanilla extract, reserve until later), lemon zest, and sugar. Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Add the gelatin mixture and cook, stirring frequently, until the gelatin is completely dissolved, about 3 minutes.",
            "Remove the vanilla bean and lemon zest with a slotted spoon. Slit the vanilla bean lengthwise with a small sharp knife and scrape the seeds out. Stir the seeds into the cream mixture. (Or add the vanilla extract, if using.)",
            "Pour the cream into a large bowl. Fill a larger bowl with ice and set the bowl with the cream in the ice. Let the cream cool, stirring frequently, until it begins to set, about 10 minutes. Pour the cream into 6 individual custard cups. Cover and chill until set, 4 hours up to overnight.",
            "Prepare the strawberry sauce, if necessary. When ready to serve, briefly dip the bottom of the cups in a bowl filled with warm water to loosen. Run a small knife around the inside of the cups. Invert the cups onto serving plates. Spoon the sauce over each and serve."
