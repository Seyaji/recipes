    "introduction": "Biscotti are a delightful treat that pairs wonderfully with coffee or tea. This recipe brings a twist to the traditional Italian cookie by using extra-virgin olive oil and adding toasted walnuts. The mild flavor of the olive oil enhances the taste of the nuts and lemon zest, resulting in a delicious and crunchy delight that's perfect for any occasion.",
    "ingredients": [
      "2 cups all-purpose flour",
      "1 teaspoon baking powder",
      "1 teaspoon salt",
      "2 large eggs, at room temperature",
      "2/3 cup sugar",
      "1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil",
      "1/2 teaspoon grated lemon zest",

    "instructions": [
      "Preheat the oven to 325°F. Grease 2 large baking sheets.",
      "In a large bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, and salt.",
      "In another large bowl, whisk the eggs, sugar, oil, and lemon zest until well blended. With a wooden spoon, stir in the dry ingredients just until blended. Stir in the walnuts.",
      "Divide the dough into four pieces. Shape the pieces into 12 × 1 1/2–inch logs, placing them several inches apart on the prepared baking sheets. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until lightly browned. Remove from the oven, but do not turn it off. Let the cookies cool on the baking sheets 10 minutes.",
