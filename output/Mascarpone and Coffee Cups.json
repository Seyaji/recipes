  "introduction": "Mascarpone and Coffee Cups blend the rich, creamy flavors of mascarpone and heavy cream with a robust coffee essence, enhanced by a touch of cognac or rum. With hints of chopped semisweet chocolate for texture, this dessert is reminiscent of tiramisu, offering an indulgent treat without the inclusion of cookies.",
  "ingredients": [
    "1/3 cup hot strong brewed espresso",
    "1/4 cup sugar",
    "1/4 cup cognac or rum",
    "4 ounces (1/2 cup) mascarpone, at room temperature",
    "1 cup heavy or whipping cream",
    "1/2 cup chopped semisweet chocolate (about 2 ounces)"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "At least 20 minutes before you are ready to make the dessert, place a medium bowl and the beaters of an electric mixer in the refrigerator. Combine the espresso and sugar. Stir until the sugar is dissolved. Stir in the cognac. Let cool to room temperature.",
    "In a large bowl, whisk the mascarpone and coffee together until smooth. Remove the bowl and beaters from the refrigerator. Pour the cream into the bowl and whip the cream at high speed until it holds its shape softly when the beaters are lifted, about 4 minutes.",
    "With a flexible spatula, gently fold the cream into the mascarpone mixture. Set aside 2 tablespoons of the chocolate for garnish, and fold the remaining chocolate into the mascarpone.",
    "Spoon the mixture into six goblets. Sprinkle with the reserved chocolate. Cover and chill 1 hour up to overnight."
