  "introduction": "Linguine with Clam Sauce is a classic Italian dish known for its simplicity and rich ocean flavors. The dish traditionally uses tender, small clams such as Manila clams or littlenecks, and Italians often prefer the dime-sized vongole clams. This pasta dish is prized for its delicate balance of garlic, extra-virgin olive oil, and fresh parsley, without the addition of grated cheese to preserve its authentic taste. Perfect for a comforting yet elegant dinner, this recipe showcases the beauty of minimalistic Italian cooking.",
  "ingredients": [
    "3 pounds small hard-shell clams or New Zealand cockles, well scrubbed",
    "1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling",
    "4 garlic cloves, finely chopped",
    "2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley",
    "Pinch of crushed red pepper",
    "1 pound linguine",
    "Salt"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Place the clams in a large pot with 1/4 cup water over medium-high heat. Cover the pot and cook until the liquid is boiling and the clams begin to open. Remove the opened clams with a slotted spoon and transfer to a bowl. Continue cooking the unopened clams. Discard any that refuse to open. Reserve the clam juices.",
    "Working over a small bowl to catch the juices, scrape the clams from the shells, placing them in another bowl. Pour all of the liquid from the pot into the bowl with the juices. If the clams are sandy, rinse them one at a time in the clam juices. Pass the liquid through a fine-mesh strainer lined with cheesecloth.",
    "Pour the oil into a skillet large enough to hold the cooked pasta. Add the garlic, parsley, and crushed red pepper. Cook over medium heat until the garlic is golden, about 2 minutes. Add the clam juices. Cook until the liquid is reduced by half. Stir in the clams. Cook 1 minute more.",
    "Meanwhile, bring at least 4 quarts of water to a boil in a large pot. Add 2 tablespoons of salt, then the linguine, gently pushing it down until the pasta is completely covered with water. Stir well. Cook, stirring frequently, until the linguine is al dente, tender yet still firm to the bite. Drain the pasta.",
    "Transfer the pasta to the skillet with the sauce and toss well over high heat. Add a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil and toss again. Serve immediately."
