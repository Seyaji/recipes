      "step": 1,
      "text": "In a large bowl, beat the eggs, cheese, and salt and pepper to taste. Stir in the spaghetti and salami."

    {
      "step": 2,
      "text": "In a 9-inch nonstick skillet, heat the oil over medium heat. Add half of the spaghetti mixture. Cover with the cheese slices. Pour the remaining pasta mixture over the cheese."
    },
    {
      "step": 3,
      "text": "Reduce the heat to low. Cook the spaghetti, flattening the surface occasionally, so the pasta sticks together and forms a cake. After about 5 minutes, slide a spatula around the rim of the skillet and lift the cake gently to be sure that it is not sticking. Cook until the eggs are set and the frittata is lightly browned on the bottom, about 15 to 20 minutes."
    },
    {
      "step": 4,
      "text": "Slide the frittata onto a plate, then invert the skillet over the plate. Quickly flip both the plate and skillet so that the frittata is cooked-side up. Cook until just set in the center, about 5 minutes more. Or, if you prefer not to flip it, slide the skillet under the broiler for 3 to 5 minutes or until set to taste. Serve hot or at room temperature."
