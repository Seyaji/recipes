        "yield": "Makes 6 to 8 servings",
        "introduction": "This dish features tender asparagus topped with buttery, semisoft taleggio cheese, a true gem from Lombardy, Italy. The cheese's richness is beautifully complemented by the crunch of pine nuts and the slight crisp of bread crumbs. A simple yet elegant dish that showcases the flavors of the Milanese region, offering an authentic Italian dining experience.",
        "ingredients": [
            "2 pounds asparagus",
            "Salt",
            "2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted",
            "6 ounces taleggio, Fontina Valle d'Aosta or Bel Paese, cut into bite-size pieces",
            "1/4 cup chopped pine nuts or sliced almonds",
            "1 tablespoon plain bread crumbs"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Place a rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 450°F. Butter a 13 × 9 × 2–inch baking dish.",
            "Trim off the base of the asparagus at the point where the stem turns from white to green. To peel the asparagus, start below the tip and, using a swivel-blade peeler, strip away the dark green peel down to the stem end.",
            "Bring about 2 inches of water to a boil in a large skillet. Add the asparagus and salt to taste. Cook until the asparagus bend slightly when you lift them by the stem end, 4 to 8 minutes. Cooking time will depend on the thickness of the asparagus. Remove the asparagus with tongs. Drain them on paper towels and pat them dry.",
            "Arrange the asparagus in the baking dish. Drizzle with the butter. Scatter the cheese over the asparagus. Sprinkle with the nuts and bread crumbs.",
            "Bake until the cheese is melted and the nuts are browned, about 15 minutes. Serve hot."
