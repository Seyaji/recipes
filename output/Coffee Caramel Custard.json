  "yield": "Makes 6 servings",
  "introduction": "This exquisite Tuscan dessert mirrors the texture of traditional crème caramel but distinguishes itself by omitting milk and cream. The result is a rich, dark, and dense custard that harkens back to its namesake's loaf-shaped presentation in Italian cuisine.",
  "ingredients": [
    "2 cups hot strong brewed espresso",
    "1 1/2 cups sugar",
    "2 tablespoons water",
    "5 large eggs",
    "1 tablespoon rum or cognac"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Place a rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Have ready 6 heatproof custard cups.",
    "In a large bowl, whisk the espresso with 3/4 cup of the sugar until the sugar is dissolved. Let stand until the coffee is at room temperature, about 30 minutes.",
    "In a small heavy saucepan, combine the remaining 3/4 cup of sugar and the water. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar is completely dissolved, about 3 minutes. When the mixture begins to boil, stop stirring and cook until the syrup starts to brown around the edges. Then gently swirl the pan over the heat until the syrup is an even golden brown, about 2 minutes more. Protecting your hand with an oven mitt, immediately pour the hot caramel into the custard cups.",
    "In a large bowl, beat the eggs until blended. Stir in the cooled coffee and the rum. Pour the mixture through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl, then add it to the custard cups.",
    "Place the cups in a large roasting pan. Place the pan in the center of the oven, then pour hot water into the pan to a depth of 1 inch. Bake 30 minutes or until a knife inserted 1/2 inch from the center of the custards comes out clean. Transfer the cups from the pan to the rack to cool. Cover and chill at least 3 hours or overnight.",
    "To serve, run a small knife around the inside of each custard cup. Invert onto serving plates and serve immediately."
