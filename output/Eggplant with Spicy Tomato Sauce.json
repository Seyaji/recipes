  "ingredients": [
    "2 medium eggplants (about 1 pound each)",
    "Salt",
    "Olive oil",
    "2 garlic cloves, crushed",
    "2 cups tomato puree",
    "1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper",
    "1/2 cup torn fresh basil leaves"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "1. Trim the tops and bottoms of the eggplants. Cut the eggplants crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Arrange the slices in a colander, sprinkling each layer with salt. Place the colander over a plate to drain for at least 30 minutes. Rinse off the salt with cool water and dry the slices with paper towels.",
    "2. Place a rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 450Â°F. Brush two large jelly roll pans with oil. Arrange the eggplant slices in a single layer. Brush with oil. Bake until lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Turn the slices with a metal spatula and bake until the second side is browned and the slices are tender when pierced, about 10 minutes more.",
    "3. In a medium saucepan, cook the garlic in 1/4 cup olive oil over medium heat until golden, about 2 minutes. Add the tomato puree, red pepper, and salt to taste. Simmer for 15 minutes or until thick. Discard the garlic.",
    "4. In a shallow dish, arrange half the eggplant in a single layer. Spread with half the sauce and basil. Repeat with the remaining ingredients. Serve at room temperature."
