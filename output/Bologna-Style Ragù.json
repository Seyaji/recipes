    "introduction": "Bologna-Style Ragù, or Ragù Bolognese, is a rich, flavorful meat sauce that exemplifies the culinary traditions of Bologna. The sauce derives its deep flavor from the slow cooking of soffritto—a combination of aromatic vegetables and pancetta. This ragù is perfect for serving over fresh egg pasta like tortellini, and it's a staple in the cuisine for its versatility and rich taste.",
