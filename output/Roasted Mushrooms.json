        "introduction": "Roasted Mushrooms, or Funghi al Forno, are a delicious treat, especially when mushrooms are in season. Porcini mushrooms are typically used for this recipe, but other varieties like cremini, portobello, or white mushrooms also work perfectly. Roasting brings out a tender yet meaty interior with lightly browned edges as long as they aren't overcrowded in the pan.",
        "ingredients": [
            "1 pound mushrooms, such as white, cremini, or portobello",
            "4 large garlic cloves, thinly sliced",
            "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil",
            "Salt and freshly ground black pepper"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "1. Place a rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Wipe the mushrooms clean with damp paper towels. Snap off the stems of the mushrooms and trim the ends where soil collects. Cut the mushrooms into quarters, or eighths if large. In a roasting pan large enough to hold the ingredients in a single layer, toss the mushrooms, garlic, and oil with salt and pepper to taste. Spread them evenly in the pan.",
            "2. Roast 30 minutes, stirring once or twice, until the mushrooms are tender and browned. Serve hot."
