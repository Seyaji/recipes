  "title": "Watermelon Granita",
  "titleAlternative": "Granita di Cocomero",
  "yield": "Makes 6 servings",
  "introduction": "The flavor in this granita is so concentrated and the coolness so refreshing, it may even be better than fresh watermelon. It is a favorite in Sicily, where summers can be extremely hot.",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 cup water",
    "1/2 cup sugar",
    "4 cups watermelon chunks, seeds removed",
    "2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, or to taste"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "In a small saucepan, combine the water with the sugar. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, then cook, stirring occasionally, until the sugar dissolves, about 3 minutes. Let cool slightly, then refrigerate until cold, about 1 hour.",
    "Chill a 13 × 9 × 2–inch metal pan in the freezer. Put the watermelon chunks in a blender or food processor and blend until smooth. Pour through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl to eliminate any pieces of seeds. You should have about 2 cups juice.",
    "In a large bowl, stir together the juice and the syrup. Add lemon juice to taste.",
    "Remove the pan from the freezer, then pour the mixture into it. Freeze 30 minutes or until a 1-inch border of ice crystals forms around the edges. Stir the ice crystals into the center of the mixture. Return the pan to the freezer and continue freezing, stirring every 30 minutes, until all of the liquid is frozen, about 2 to 2 1/2 hours. Serve immediately, or scrape the mixture into a plastic container, cover, and store in the freezer up to 24 hours.",
    "Remove from the freezer to soften about 15 minutes before serving, if necessary."
  ],
  "variations": "You can experiment by adding a splash of mint or basil for a fresh twist, or swap the watermelon for another juicy fruit like cantaloupe or honeydew."
