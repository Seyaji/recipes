    "introduction": "Chickpea Soup from Puglia, also known as Minestra di Ceci, is a hearty and flavorful dish that uses simple ingredients to create a comforting meal. This thick soup incorporates short strips of fresh pasta, known as lagane, which can be substituted with fresh fettuccine or small dried pasta. Anchovies are the secret ingredient that dissolve into the soup, adding depth without overwhelming the flavor.",
    "ingredients": [
      "1⁄3 cup olive oil",
      "3 garlic cloves, slightly crushed",
      "2 2-inch sprigs fresh rosemary",
      "4 anchovy fillets, chopped",
      "3 1⁄2 cups cooked chickpeas or 2 16-ounce cans, drained and liquid reserved",
      "4 ounces fresh fettuccine, cut into 3-inch lengths",
      "Freshly ground black pepper"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Pour the oil into a large pot. Add the garlic and rosemary and cook over medium heat, pressing the garlic cloves with the back of a large spoon, until the garlic is golden, about 2 minutes. Remove and discard the garlic and rosemary. Add the anchovy fillets and cook, stirring, until the anchovy dissolves, about 3 minutes.",
      "Add the chickpeas to the pot and stir well. Coarsely mash half of the chickpeas with the back of a spoon or a potato masher. Add just enough water or chickpea cooking liquid to cover the chickpeas. Bring the liquid to a simmer.",
      "Stir in the pasta. Season to taste with a generous grind of black pepper. Cook until the pasta is tender yet firm to the bite. Remove from the heat and let stand 5 minutes. Serve hot, with a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil."
