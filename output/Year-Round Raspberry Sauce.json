  "title": "Year-Round Raspberry Sauce",
  "titleAlternative": "Salsa di Lampone",
  "yield": "Makes about 2 cups",
  "introduction": "Even when berries are out of season, you can still create a deliciously fresh-tasting raspberry sauce. This sauce pairs beautifully with almond and chocolate desserts or cakes, and it also shines when drizzled over slices of cantaloupe. You can use frozen blueberries, strawberries, or a mix of these berries if you prefer. In case you can't find berries in syrup, use unsweetened fruit and adjust the sweetness with sugar to your liking.",
  "ingredients": [
    "2 (10-ounce) packages frozen raspberries in syrup, partially thawed",
    "1 teaspoon cornstarch mixed with 2 tablespoons water",
    "About 1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Pass the berries through a food mill fitted with a fine blade, or puree them in a food processor and press them through a fine-mesh strainer.",
    "Bring the puree to a simmer in a small saucepan. Stir in the cornstarch mixture and cook, stirring frequently, until slightly thickened, about 1 minute. Stir in the lemon juice. Let cool slightly. Serve or transfer to an airtight container and store in the refrigerator up to 3 days."
