  "introduction": "Mushrooms are a staple in Genoa cuisine, thanks to the region's abundant wild varieties that inspire numerous savory dishes. Traditionally made with porcini mushrooms, this dish is delectable with meaty portobello mushrooms, offering a rich, umami flavor profile. It's a versatile dish perfect as a side or the centerpiece of a meatless meal.",
  "ingredients": [
    "6 large portobello mushrooms",
    "4 tablespoons olive oil",
    "Salt and freshly ground black pepper",
    "2 garlic cloves, finely chopped",
    "3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley",
    "1 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary",
    "1/2 teaspoon dried marjoram"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Place a rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 425Â°F. Oil a baking pan large enough to hold the mushroom caps in a single layer.",
    "Wipe the mushrooms clean with damp paper towels. Snap off the stems of the mushrooms and trim the ends where soil collects. Thinly slice the stems. Place the mushroom stems in a bowl and toss them with 2 tablespoons of the oil.",
    "Place the mushroom caps open-side up in the pan. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.",
    "In a small bowl, stir together the garlic, parsley, rosemary, marjoram, and salt and pepper to taste. Toss with the remaining 2 tablespoons oil. Place a pinch of the herb mixture on each mushroom cap. Top with the stems.",
    "Bake 15 minutes. Check the mushrooms to see if the pan is too dry. Add a little warm water if needed. Bake 15 minutes more or until tender. Serve hot or at room temperature."
