        "introduction": "The sweet, mild, almost floral taste of ripe pears lends itself to many other complementary flavors. Fruits such as oranges, lemons, and berries and many cheeses go well with them, and Marsala and dry wines are often used to poach pears. In Piedmont, these pears are simmered in a spiced rum syrup, making a delightful accompaniment to desserts such as a simple hazelnut cake.",
        "ingredients": [
            "6 Anjou, Bartlett, or Bosc pears, not too ripe",
            "1/4 cup brown sugar",
            "1/4 cup dark rum",
            "1/4 cup water",
            "4 whole cloves"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Peel the pears, leaving the stems intact. With a melon baller or small spoon, scoop out the core and seeds, working from the bottom of the pears.",
            "In a saucepan just large enough to hold the pears, stir together the sugar, rum, and water over medium heat until the sugar is melted, about 5 minutes. Add the pears. Scatter the cloves around the fruit.",
            "Cover the pan and bring the liquid to a simmer. Cook over medium-low heat 15 to 20 minutes or until the pears are tender when pierced with a knife. With a slotted spoon, transfer the pears to a serving dish.",
            "Simmer the liquid uncovered until reduced and syrupy. Strain the liquid over the pears. Let cool.",
            "Serve at room temperature or cover and chill in the refrigerator."
