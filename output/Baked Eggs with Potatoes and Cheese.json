  "introduction": "Neapolitan comfort food is the best way to describe this layered casserole of potatoes, cheese, and eggs. Perfectly baked, the dish brings warmth and coziness, reminiscent of childhood meals.",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 pound all-purpose potatoes, such as Yukon gold",
    "Salt",
    "1 tablespoon unsalted butter",
    "8 ounces fresh mozzarella, sliced",
    "4 large eggs",
    "Freshly ground black pepper",
    "2 tablespoons Parmigiano-Reggiano"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "1. Scrub the potatoes and peel them. Cut them into 1⁄4-inch-thick slices. Place the potatoes in a medium saucepan with cold water to cover and salt to taste. Cover and bring to a simmer. Cook until the potatoes are just tender when pierced with a fork, about 10 minutes. Drain the potatoes and cool slightly.",
    "2. Place a rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 400°F. Smear the butter around the bottom and sides of a 9-inch square baking dish. Arrange the potato slices in the pan, overlapping them slightly. Place the cheese slices on top of the potatoes. Break the eggs into a small cup, then slide them into the pan on top of the cheese. Sprinkle with salt, pepper, and the grated Parmigiano-Reggiano.",
    "3. Bake until the eggs are set to taste, about 15 minutes. Serve hot."
