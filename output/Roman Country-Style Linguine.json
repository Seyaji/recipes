    "introduction": "Roman Country-Style Linguine, also known as Linguine alla Ciociara, is a delightful pasta dish that captures the essence of Italian countryside cooking. The fresh, grassy flavor of green bell pepper makes this simple pasta unusual and gives it a unique twist. Ideal for a casual dinner, this recipe highlights the use of fresh tomatoes, mild oil-cured black olives, and Pecorino Romano cheese, all enveloped in a delicately spicy sauce.",
    "ingredients": [
      "1 medium green bell pepper",
      "1/2 cup olive oil",
      "2 cups peeled, seeded, and chopped fresh tomatoes or drained and chopped canned imported Italian tomatoes",
      "1/2 cup coarsely chopped Gaeta or other mild oil-cured black olives",
      "Salt",
      "Pinch of crushed red pepper",
      "1 pound linguine or spaghetti",
      "1/2 cup freshly grated Pecorino Romano"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Cut the pepper in half and remove the stem and seeds. Cut the pepper into very thin lengthwise slices, then cut the slices crosswise into thirds.",
      "In a skillet large enough to hold the cooked spaghetti, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the tomatoes, pepper, olives, salt to taste, and crushed red pepper. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is slightly thickened, about 20 minutes.",
      "Bring at least 4 quarts of water to a boil in a large pot. Add 2 tablespoons of salt, then the pasta. Stir well. Cook over high heat, stirring frequently, until the pasta is al dente, tender yet still firm to the bite. Drain the pasta, reserving some of the cooking water.",
      "Add the pasta to the skillet with the sauce. Cook and toss over medium heat for 1 minute, adding some of the reserved cooking water if the pasta seems dry. Add the cheese and toss again. Serve immediately."
