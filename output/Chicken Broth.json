        "introduction": "Chicken broth offers a rich, hearty flavor, especially when made from an old chicken, known as a fowl. The depth of taste is unmatched, providing the perfect base for soups, stews, or as a cooking liquid for grains. Even after boiling, the usable meat can be repurposed, showcasing the thrifty ingenuity of Italian cooking.",
        "ingredients": [
            "1 4-pound whole fowl or chicken",
            "2 pounds chicken or turkey parts",
            "2 celery ribs with leaves, cut up",
            "2 carrots, cut up",
            "2 medium onions, peeled and left whole",
            "1 large tomato or 1 cup chopped canned tomatoes",
            "1 garlic clove",
            "3 or 4 sprigs fresh parsley"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Place the fowl and chicken or turkey parts in a large stockpot. Add 5 quarts cold water and bring to a simmer over medium heat.",
            "Adjust the heat so that the water is barely simmering. Skim off the foam and fat that rises to the surface of the broth.",
            "Once the foam stops rising, add the remaining ingredients. Cook 2 hours, regulating the heat so that the liquid bubbles gently.",
            "Let the broth cool briefly, then strain it into plastic storage containers. The broth can be used right away, or let it cool completely, then cover and store it in the refrigerator up to 3 days or in the freezer up to 3 months."
