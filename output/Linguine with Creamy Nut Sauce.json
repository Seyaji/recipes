  "introduction": "Linguine with Creamy Nut Sauce marries the rich, nutty flavors of walnuts and pine nuts with the creamy texture of ricotta. The result is a luxurious pasta dish that is both simple to prepare and deeply satisfying. The light, dry notes of a Piedmontese dolcetto wine pair perfectly with this elegant dish.",
  "ingredients": [
    "1/2 cup walnuts",
    "2 tablespoons pine nuts",
    "4 tablespoons unsalted butter",
    "1 small garlic clove, very finely chopped",
    "1 tablespoon chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley",
    "1/4 cup whole or part-skim ricotta, mascarpone, or heavy cream",
    "Salt",
    "1 pound linguine",
    "1/2 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Place the walnuts and pine nuts in a food processor or blender. Grind the nuts just until fine. (Don't overprocess into a paste.)",
    "In a medium skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the garlic and parsley and cook 1 minute. Stir in the ground nuts and ricotta. Stir to blend and heat through.",
    "Meanwhile, bring about 4 quarts of water to a boil in a large pot. Add 2 tablespoons of salt, then the pasta, gently pushing it down until the pasta is completely covered with water. Stir well. Cook, stirring often, until the pasta is al dente, tender yet still firm to the bite. Set aside some of the cooking water. Drain the pasta.",
    "In a large heated serving bowl, toss the pasta with the sauce and grated cheese. Add a little of the cooking water if the pasta seems dry. Serve immediately."
