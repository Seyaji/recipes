  "introduction": "Bluefish, known for their rich and robust flavor due to their higher fat content, are a favorite in southern Italian cuisine. This recipe captures their essence with a refreshing marinade of garlic, mint, and lemon that perfectly complements the fish's natural taste.",
  "ingredients": [
    "2 large garlic cloves, finely chopped",
    "3 tablespoons olive oil",
    "1/4 cup fresh lemon juice",
    "1/2 teaspoon freshly grated lemon zest",
    "Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste",
    "1/4 cup chopped fresh mint",
    "1 1/2 pounds bluefish or mackerel fillets"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "1. In a shallow bowl, whisk together the garlic, olive oil, lemon juice, zest, and salt and pepper. Stir in the mint. Add the fish, turning the fillets to coat them on all sides. Cover and marinate 1 hour in the refrigerator.",
    "2. Preheat the broiler. Place the fish in the broiler pan skin-side down. Cook, basting the fillets once with the marinade, 8 to 10 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fish, or until they are lightly browned and just barely opaque in the thickest part. There is no need to turn the fish. Serve hot."
