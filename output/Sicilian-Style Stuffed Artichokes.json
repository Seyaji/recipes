        "introduction": "Sicilian-Style Stuffed Artichokes is a delightful dish that embodies the flavors of Sicily. This version of stuffed artichokes is more intricate than the traditional recipe, incorporating a mixture of bread crumbs, anchovies, capers, pine nuts, and raisins. This combination creates a rich and savory stuffing that pairs wonderfully with the tender artichokes. Serve this as a first course before a hearty main dish like roasted fish or leg of lamb.",
        "ingredients": [
            "4 medium artichokes, prepared for stuffing",
            "1/2 cup plain bread crumbs",
            "4 anchovy fillets, finely chopped",
            "2 tablespoons chopped drained capers",
            "2 tablespoons pine nuts, toasted",
            "2 tablespoons golden raisins",
            "2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley",
            "1 large garlic clove, finely chopped",
            "Salt and freshly ground black pepper",
            "4 tablespoons olive oil",
            "1/2 cup dry white wine",
            "Water"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "In a medium bowl, combine the bread crumbs, anchovies, capers, pine nuts, raisins, parsley, garlic, and salt and pepper to taste. Stir in two tablespoons of the oil.",
            "Gently spread the leaves apart. Stuff the artichokes loosely with the bread crumb mixture, also adding a little stuffing between the leaves. Do not pack the stuffing in.",
            "Stand the artichokes in a pot just large enough to hold them upright. Add water to a depth of 3/4 inch around the artichokes. Drizzle with the remaining 2 tablespoons oil. Pour the wine around the artichokes.",
            "Cover the pot and place it over medium heat. When the water comes to a simmer, reduce the heat to low. Cook 40 to 50 minutes (depending on the size of the artichokes) or until the artichoke bottoms are tender when pierced with a knife and a leaf pulls out easily. Add additional warm water if needed to prevent scorching. Serve warm or at room temperature."
