        "ingredients": [
            "Salt",
            "2 cups farro",
            "1/4 cup olive oil",
            "4 ounces pancetta, chopped",
            "1 medium onion",
            "1/2 cup dry white wine",
            "1 1/2 cups peeled, seeded, and chopped fresh tomatoes, or drained and chopped canned tomatoes",
            "1/2 cup freshly grated Pecorino Romano"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Bring 6 cups of water to a boil. Add salt to taste, then the farro. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook until the farro is tender, yet still chewy, 15 to 30 minutes. (Cooking time can vary; start tasting after 15 minutes.) Drain well.",
            "In a medium skillet, cook the oil, pancetta, and onion over medium heat, stirring often, until the onion is golden, about 10 minutes. Add the wine and bring to a simmer. Add the tomatoes and farro. Bring to a simmer and cook until the farro has absorbed some of the sauce, about 10 minutes. Add a little water if needed to prevent sticking.",
            "Remove from the heat. Add the cheese and stir well. Serve immediately."
