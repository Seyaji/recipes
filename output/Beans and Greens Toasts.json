    "introduction": "Southern Italy offers a delightful combination of creamy beans served with cooked greens like broccoli rabe, chicory, or escarole. Adapted for these crostini, the Beans and Greens Toasts are perfect as a knife-and-fork meal over toasted Italian bread.",
    "ingredients": [
      "5 tablespoons olive oil",
      "2 large garlic cloves, peeled and chopped fine",
      "1 small dried chile (peperoncino preferred), crushed, or a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes",
      "1 pound broccoli rabe, chicory, or escarole, washed, trimmed, and cut into bite-size pieces",
      "1/4 cup water",
      "Salt to taste",

      "Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil and garlic 1 minute. Stir in the beans, cover, and cook over low heat until heated through, about 4 minutes. Coarsely mash the beans. Season to taste.",
      "Place a barbecue grill or broiler rack about 5 inches away from the heat source. Preheat the grill or broiler.",
      "Toast the bread on one side until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Turn the bread and toast the other side, about 2 minutes. Spread the toast with the beans. Top with the greens and a spoonful of their cooking liquid. Serve immediately."
