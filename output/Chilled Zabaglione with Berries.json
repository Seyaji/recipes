  "instructions": [
    "At least 20 minutes before you are ready to make the zabaglione, place a large bowl and the beaters of an electric mixer in the refrigerator. Fill another large bowl with ice and water.",
    "Prepare the zabaglione through step 3. As soon as the zabaglione is finished, remove it from the simmering water and set the bowl over the ice water. With a wire whisk, beat the zabaglione until it is cold, about 3 minutes.",
    "Remove the chilled bowl and beaters from the refrigerator. Pour the cream into the bowl and whip the cream at high speed until it begins to hold a soft shape, about 2 minutes. Add the confectioner's sugar and orange liqueur. Whip the cream until it holds a soft shape when the beaters are lifted, about 2 minutes more. With a flexible spatula, gently fold in the chilled zabaglione. Cover and chill in the refrigerator at least 1 hour until ready to serve.",
    "Divide the berries among 6 serving dishes. Top with the chilled zabaglione cream and serve immediately."
