    "introduction": "Risotto with 'Fruits of the Sea' is a delightful Italian dish that marries the creamy richness of risotto with the fresh, briny flavors of the ocean. Originating from the Veneto region, this dish often includes a variety of seafood such as calamari, shrimp, and scallops. It is traditionally made using Vialone Nano rice, which perfectly absorbs the broth and wine for a luscious consistency.",
    "ingredients": [
        "6 cups Chicken Broth or water",
        "6 tablespoons olive oil",
        "2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley",
        "2 large garlic cloves, finely chopped",
        "1/2 pound calamari (squid), cut into 1/2-inch rings and tentacles halved through the base",
        "1/4 pound shrimp, shelled and deveined and cut into 1/2-inch pieces",
        "1/4 pound scallops, cut into 1/2-inch pieces",
        "Salt",
        "Pinch of crushed red pepper",
        "1 medium onion, finely chopped",
        "2 cups medium-grain rice, such as Arborio, Carnaroli, or Vialone Nano",
        "1/2 cup dry white wine",
        "1 cup peeled, seeded, and chopped tomatoes"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Prepare the broth, if necessary. Put 3 tablespoons oil with the garlic and parsley into a wide heavy saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the garlic is softened and golden, about 2 minutes. Add all the seafood, salt to taste, and red pepper and cook, stirring until the calamari are just opaque, about 5 minutes.",
        "With a slotted spoon, remove the seafood to a plate. Add the chicken broth to the pan and bring to a simmer. Keep the broth over very low heat while cooking the risotto.",
        "In a wide heavy saucepan, over medium heat, cook the onion in the remaining 3 tablespoons of the oil until golden, about 10 minutes.",
        "Add the rice and cook, stirring with a wooden spoon, until hot, about 2 minutes. Stir in the wine. Cook until most of the liquid is absorbed. Add 1/2 cup of the hot broth and stir until the liquid is absorbed. Continue adding the broth 1/2 cup at a time, stirring after each addition. Adjust the heat so that the liquid simmers rapidly but the rice does not stick to the pan. About halfway through the cooking, stir in the tomato, and salt to taste.",
        "Use only as much of the broth as needed until the rice becomes tender yet firm to the bite and the risotto is creamy. When you think it may be done, taste a few grains. If not ready, test again in a minute or so. If the broth runs out before the rice is tender, use hot water. Cooking time is 18 to 20 minutes.",
        "Add the seafood to the pot and cook 1 minute more. Remove the risotto pan from the heat. Serve immediately."

    "variations": "Tiny clams or mussels can be added to this risotto, or even bits of firm fish such as tuna."
