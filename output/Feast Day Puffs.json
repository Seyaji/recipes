    "introduction": "Zeppole are delightful fried dough puffs popular at street fairs in Italian neighborhoods. These fluffy treats are enjoyed hot and fresh, usually sprinkled with confectioner’s sugar. In many homes, including mine, zeppole served with a dash of cinnamon sugar or dipped in warm honey are cherished Sunday night desserts. My friend Donatella Arpaia, an excellent cook and owner of the New York restaurant Bellini, often serves Zeppole with hot chocolate sauce, offering a rich, indulgent variation to this delightful delicacy.",
    "ingredients": [
      "1 teaspoon active dry yeast or instant yeast",
      "2 teaspoons sugar",
      "3/4 cup warm water (100° to 110°F)",

      "Confectioner's sugar"

    "instructions": [
      "In a small bowl, sprinkle the yeast and sugar over the water. Let stand until creamy, about 2 minutes. Stir until the yeast dissolves.",
      "In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Add the yeast mixture and stir until well blended. Cover with plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm place for 1 1/2 hours.",
      "In a deep heavy saucepan, pour enough oil to reach a depth of 2 inches, or if using an electric deep-fryer, follow the manufacturer's directions. Heat the oil to 370°F on a frying thermometer, or until a drop of the dough slipped into the oil sizzles and browns in 1 minute. Have ready a tray lined with paper towels.",
      "Scoop up a rounded tablespoon of the dough. Use a second spoon to slip the dough off the spoon into the oil. Do not crowd the pan. Cook the zeppole until golden brown and puffed, about 3 minutes.",
      "Remove the zeppole with a slotted spoon or skimmer and drain on paper towels. Fry the remainder in the same way. Dust generously with confectioner's sugar. Serve hot."
