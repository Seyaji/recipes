  "ingredients": [
    "6 small eggplants (about 1½ pounds)",
    "Salt",
    "¼ cup olive oil",
    "1 medium onion, chopped",
    "1 medium tomato",
    "2 eggs, beaten",

  "instructions": [
    "1. Trim off the tops of the eggplants and cut them in half lengthwise. With a small sharp knife and a spoon, scoop out the pulp of the eggplants, leaving the shells about ¼ inch thick. Chop the eggplant pulp.",
    "2. Place the chopped eggplant in a colander. Sprinkle generously with salt and let drain over a plate for at least 30 minutes. Sprinkle the eggplant shells with salt and place them cut-sides down on a plate to drain.",
    "3. Rinse off the salt with cool water and dry the eggplant with paper towels. Squeeze the pulp to extract the water.",
    "4. In a medium skillet, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the onion and chopped eggplant and cook, stirring frequently, until tender, about 15 minutes. Scrape the mixture into a bowl.",
    "5. Cut the tomato in half and squeeze out the seeds and juice. Chop the tomato and add it to the bowl. Stir in the eggs, cheese, basil, prosciutto, ½ cup bread crumbs, and salt and pepper to taste. Mix well.",
    "6. Place a rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 400°F. Oil a baking pan just large enough to hold the eggplant shells in a single layer.",
    "7. Fill the shells with the eggplant mixture, rounding the surface. Place them in the pan. Sprinkle with the 1 tablespoon bread crumbs. Pour ¼ cup of water around the eggplants. Bake 45 to 50 minutes or until the shells are tender when pierced. Serve hot or at room temperature."
