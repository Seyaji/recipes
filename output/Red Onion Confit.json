    "introduction": "Red onion confit, also known as Confettura di Cipolle Rosse, is a delightful jam made from sweet red onions, a specialty of Tropea on the Calabrian coast. This versatile condiment pairs well with fried sardines, pork chops, grilled chicken, or as an accompaniment to sharp cheeses like aged pecorino.",
    "ingredients": [
      "1 1/4 pounds red onions, very finely chopped",
      "1 cup dry red wine",
      "1 teaspoon salt",
      "2 tablespoons unsalted butter",
      "1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar",
      "1 or 2 tablespoons honey",
      "Approximately 1 tablespoon sugar"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "1. In a medium heavy saucepan, combine the onions, red wine, and salt over medium heat. Bring to a simmer and turn the heat to low. Cover and cook, stirring often, for 1 hour 15 minutes or until the onions are very tender. The onions will be slightly translucent.",
      "2. Stir in the butter, balsamic vinegar, and 1 tablespoon each of the honey and sugar. Cook uncovered, stirring often, until all of the liquid has evaporated and the mixture is very thick.",
      "3. Let cool slightly. Serve at room temperature or slightly warm. This keeps in the refrigerator for up to a month. To reheat, place the confit in a small bowl set over a pan of simmering water, or warm it in a microwave."
    ],
    "variations": [
      "A variation of the jam includes some chopped fresh mint. Be sure to use a heavy-bottomed saucepan and keep the heat very low to prevent the onions from sticking. Add a little water if they dry out too quickly."
