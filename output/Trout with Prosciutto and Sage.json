    "introduction": "Trout with Prosciutto and Sage brings together the natural flavors of trout and complements them with the savory taste of prosciutto and the aromatic touch of sage. This traditional recipe from the Friuli–Venezia Giulia region in Italy showcases a delightful balance between the earthiness of fresh herbs and the rich, salty flavor of Italian prosciutto.",
    "ingredients": [
      "4 small whole trout, cleaned, about 12 ounces each",
      "4 tablespoons olive oil",
      "2 to 3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice",
      "6 fresh sage leaves, finely chopped",
      "Salt and freshly ground black pepper",
      "8 very thin slices imported Italian prosciutto",
      "1 lemon, cut into wedges"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Oil a baking pan large enough to hold the fish in a single layer.",
      "In a small bowl, combine the oil, lemon juice, sage, and salt and pepper to taste. Sprinkle the fish inside and out with the mixture. Marinate the fish in the refrigerator for 1 hour.",
      "Place the oven rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 375°F. Place a slice of prosciutto inside each fish and lay another slice on top. Bake 20 minutes or until the fish is just opaque when cut with a small sharp knife near the bone. Serve hot with lemon wedges."
