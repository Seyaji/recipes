  "introduction": "Neapolitan Tomato and Bread Salad, also known as La Caponata in Naples, is a refreshing and flavorful dish that highlights a clever Italian technique of adding ice cubes. This method cools the ingredients slightly and allows the melting ice to extend the vegetable juices, soaking into the bread. Unlike the Sicilian caponata, this version uses toasted bread or traditional freselle, a crisp hard biscuit.",

    "4 freselle or 1-inch-thick slices of Italian or French bread, toasted",
    "2 large ripe tomatoes",
    "2 small kirby cucumbers, sliced",

    "4 fresh basil leaves, torn into small pieces",
    "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil",
    "About 2 tablespoons white vinegar",
    "Salt and freshly ground black pepper",
    "8 ice cubes"
