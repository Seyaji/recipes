    "titleAlternative": "Pappa al Pomodoro",
    "yield": "Makes 4 servings",
    "introduction": "This hearty Tuscan soup is a favorite during early autumn when ripe tomatoes and fresh leeks are abundant. It's a deliciously rustic dish, perfect for cooler days and can also be made with canned tomatoes during the winter. Unlike many soups, bread is used instead of pasta or rice, providing a comforting and thick texture that is sure to warm you up.",
    "ingredients": [
      "6 cups homemade Chicken Broth or a mix of half store-bought broth and half water",
      "3 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for drizzling",
      "2 medium leeks, trimmed and finely chopped",
      "3 large garlic cloves, minced",
      "Pinch of crushed red pepper",
      "2 cups peeled, seeded, and chopped fresh tomatoes, or canned tomatoes",
      "Salt to taste",
      "1/2 loaf day-old Italian whole-wheat bread, cut into 1-inch cubes (about 4 cups)",
      "1/2 cup torn fresh basil",
      "Extra-virgin olive oil"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Prepare the broth if necessary. Trim off the roots and dark green portion of the leeks, cut them in half lengthwise and rinse thoroughly under cool running water. Chop finely.",
      "Pour the oil into a large pot. Add the leeks and cook, stirring frequently, over medium-low heat until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic and crushed red pepper.",
      "Add the tomatoes and broth, then bring to a simmer. Cook for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add salt to taste.",
      "Stir the bread into the soup and cook for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. The soup should be thick; add more bread if necessary.",
      "Remove from heat and stir in the basil. Let stand for 10 minutes. Serve hot with a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil."
