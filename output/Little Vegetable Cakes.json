    "introduction": "In Sicily, these delightful vegetable cakes are crafted using a variety of bitter wild greens such as broccoli rabe, mustard greens, borage, or chicory. Traditionally enjoyed during Easter as either an appetizer or a side dish, they can be savored hot or at room temperature.",
    "ingredients": [
      "1 1/2 pounds broccoli rabe",
      "Salt",
      "4 large eggs",
      "2 tablespoons grated caciocavallo or Pecorino Romano",
      "Salt and freshly ground black pepper",
      "2 tablespoons olive oil"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Separate the broccoli rabe into florets. Trim off the base of the stems. Peeling the stems is optional. Cut each floret crosswise into 1-inch pieces.",
      "Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the broccoli rabe and salt to taste. Cook until the broccoli is almost tender, about 5 minutes. Drain. Let cool slightly, then press out the water. Chop broccoli rabe.",
      "In a large bowl, whisk the eggs, cheese, and salt and pepper to taste. Stir in the greens.",
      "Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Scoop up a heaping tablespoonful of the mixture and place it in the pan. Flatten the mixture with a spoon into a small pancake. Repeat with the remaining mixture. Cook one side of the cakes until lightly browned, about 2 minutes, then turn them over with a spatula and cook the other side until browned and cooked through. Serve hot or at room temperature."
