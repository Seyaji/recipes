  "instructions": [
    "In a skillet large enough to hold all the pasta, cook the garlic in the oil over medium heat until the garlic is lightly golden, about 2 minutes. Stir in the scallops, pepper, and salt to taste. Cook just until the scallops are opaque, about 1 minute.",
    "Stir in the tomato and basil. Cook 1 minute until the basil is slightly wilted. Remove the skillet from the heat.",
    "Bring at least 4 quarts of water to a boil. Add 2 tablespoons of salt, then the pasta. Stir well. Cook over high heat, stirring frequently, until the pasta is al dente, tender yet still firm to the bite. Drain the pasta, reserving some of the cooking water.",
