    "introduction": "Gratinéed Potato Gnocchi is a delightful dish from Piedmont where potato gnocchi is topped with cheeses and bread crumbs, baked to perfection. The cheeses melt and the crumbs become crunchy, creating a tantalizing contrast of textures. This dish can be prepared ahead and baked just before serving, making it a convenient yet impressive meal.",
