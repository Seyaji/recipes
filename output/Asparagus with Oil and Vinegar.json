  "introduction": "As soon as the first locally grown spears appear in the spring, I prepare them this way and eat a big batch to satisfy the craving that has developed through the long winter. Turn the asparagus in the dressing while they are still warm so that they absorb the flavor.",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 pound asparagus",
    "Salt",
    "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil",
    "1 to 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar",
    "Freshly ground black pepper"

      "description": "Trim off the base of the asparagus at the point where the stem turns from white to green. Bring about 2 inches of water to a boil in a large skillet. Add the asparagus and salt to taste. Cook until the asparagus bend slightly when you lift them from the stem end, 4 to 8 minutes. Cooking time will depend on the thickness of the asparagus. Remove the asparagus with tongs. Drain on paper towels and pat them dry."
