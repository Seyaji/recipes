      "Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Pat the tuna pieces dry with paper towels. When the oil is hot, add the tuna pieces without crowding the pan.

      "Add the bell pepper to the skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, until it begins to brown, about 10 minutes. Add the tomato, garlic, basil, and salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer. Add the beans, cover, and reduce the heat to low. Cook for 10 minutes.",
      "Stir in the tuna and cook until the tuna is slightly pink in the center, about 2 minutes more, or until done to taste. Test for doneness by making a small cut in the thickest part of the fish. Serve hot."
