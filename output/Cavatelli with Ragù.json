        "introduction": "Cavatelli with Ragù is a delightful traditional Italian dish that combines handmade cavatelli pasta with a rich and savory ragù. The process of creating the cavatelli pasta, especially if done manually, connects you to the roots of Italian cooking, making it a rewarding experience. The ragù, whether a hearty sausage variety or a simple tomato sauce, perfectly complements the chewy texture of the cavatelli, making this dish a comforting meal perfect for sharing with loved ones.",
        "ingredients": [
            "1 pound Semolina Pasta Dough prepared through step 4",
            "Salt",
            "Sausage Ragù or Sicilian Tomato Sauce"

        "instructions": [
            "Prepare the ragù or sauce. Have ready 2 baking sheets dusted with flour.",
            "Cut the dough into 1/2-inch pieces. Hold a small knife with a dull blade and rounded tip with your index finger pressed against the blade of the knife. Flatten each piece of dough, pressing and dragging it slightly so that the dough curls around the tip of the knife to form a shell shape.",
            "Spread the pieces on the prepared pans. Repeat with the remaining dough. (If you are not using the cavatelli within an hour, place the pans in the freezer. When the pieces are firm, scoop them into a plastic bag and seal tightly. Do not thaw before cooking.)",
            "To cook, bring four quarts of cold water to a boil over high heat. Add the cavatelli and 2 tablespoons of salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the pasta is tender yet still slightly chewy.",
            "Drain the cavatelli and pour them into a heated serving bowl. Toss with the sauce. Serve hot."
