        "introduction": "Batter-Fried Shrimp and Calamari is a delightful Italian dish, where fresh seafood is coated in a light, airy batter made with eggs and yeast, then fried to a golden perfection. This dish marries the delicate flavors of shrimp and calamari with a crispy exterior, providing a wonderful texture contrast and an irresistible taste. Serve these crunchy morsels with lemon wedges for a burst of freshness.",
        "ingredients": [
            "1 teaspoon active dry yeast or instant yeast",
            "1 cup warm water (100 to 110°F)",
            "2 large eggs",
            "1 cup all-purpose flour",
            "1 teaspoon salt",
            "1 pound small shrimp, shelled and deveined",
            "8 ounces cleaned calamari (squid)",
            "Vegetable oil for frying",
            "1 lemon, cut into wedges"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "In a medium bowl, sprinkle the yeast over the water. Let stand 1 minute or until creamy. Stir to dissolve.",
            "Add the eggs to the yeast mixture and beat well. Stir in the flour and salt. Beat with a whisk until smooth.",
            "Rinse the shrimp and calamari well. Pat dry. Cut the calamari crosswise into 1/2-inch rings. If large, cut the base of each group of tentacles in half.",
            "In a deep heavy saucepan, pour enough oil to reach a depth of 2 inches, or if using an electric deep-fryer, follow the manufacturer's directions. Heat the oil to 370°F on a frying thermometer or until a drop of the batter placed in the oil sizzles and browns in 1 minute.",
            "Stir the shrimp and calamari into the batter. Remove the pieces a few at a time, letting the excess batter drip back into the bowl. Very carefully place the pieces in the hot oil. Do not crowd the pan. Fry, stirring once with a slotted spoon, until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove the seafood from the pan and drain on paper towels. Fry the remainder in the same way. Serve hot with lemon wedges."
