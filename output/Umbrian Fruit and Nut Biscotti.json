Whether enjoyed with coffee or as a standalone snack, these biscotti are a perfect blend of sweetness and nutty richness.",
    "ingredients": [
      "3 cups all-purpose flour",
      "1/2 cup cornstarch",
      "2 teaspoons baking powder",
      "3 large eggs",
      "3 egg yolks",
      "2 tablespoons Marsala, vin santo, or sherry",
      "1 cup sugar",
      "1 cup raisins",
      "1 cup almonds",
      "1/4 cup chopped candied orange peel",
      "1/4 cup chopped candied citron",
      "1 teaspoon anise seeds"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Grease 2 large baking sheets.",
      "In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, cornstarch, and baking powder.",
      "In a large bowl with an electric mixer, beat together the eggs, yolks, and Marsala. Add the sugar and beat until well blended, about 3 minutes. Stir in the dry ingredients, the raisins, almonds, peel, citron, and anise seeds until blended. The dough will be stiff. If necessary, turn the dough out onto a countertop and knead it until blended.",
      "Divide the dough into quarters. Dampen your hands with cool water and shape each quarter into a 10-inch log. Place the logs 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets.",
      "Bake the logs for 20 minutes or until they feel firm when pressed in the center and are golden brown around the edges. Remove the logs from the oven but leave the oven on. Let the logs cool for 5 minutes on the baking sheets.",
      "Slide the logs onto a cutting board. With a large chef's knife, cut them into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Place the slices on the baking sheets and bake for 10 minutes or until lightly toasted.",
      "Have ready 2 large cooling racks. Transfer the cookies to the racks and let cool completely. Store in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks."
