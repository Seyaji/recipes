  "introduction": "Marinated Eggplant with Garlic and Mint is a delightful side dish or antipasto that's perfect with grilled chicken or as part of a larger spread. The eggplants are marinated in a flavorful mixture of garlic, fresh mint, and red wine vinegar, resulting in a dish that's both refreshing and full of depth. This versatile recipe can also be applied to zucchini and carrots.",
  "ingredients": [
    "2 medium eggplants (about 1 pound each)",
    "Salt",
    "Olive oil",
    "3 tablespoons red wine vinegar",
    "2 garlic cloves, finely chopped",
    "1/4 cup chopped fresh mint",
    "Freshly ground black pepper"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Trim the tops and bottoms of the eggplants. Cut the eggplants crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Arrange the slices in a colander, sprinkling each layer with salt. Place the eggplant over a plate to drain for at least 30 minutes. Rinse off the salt with cool water and dry the slices with paper towels.",
    "Preheat the oven to 450Â°F. Brush the eggplant slices with the oil and arrange them oiled-side down in a single layer on cookie sheets. Brush the tops with oil. Bake the slices for 10 minutes. Turn and bake until browned and tender, about 10 minutes more.",
    "In a shallow plastic container with a tight-fitting lid, make a layer of the eggplant slices, overlapping them slightly. Sprinkle with vinegar, garlic, mint, and pepper. Repeat the layering until all of the ingredients are used.",
    "Cover and refrigerate for at least 24 hours before serving. These keep well for several days."
