        "introduction": "This distinctive Black Risotto, traditionally from Venice, uses squid or cuttlefish ink to give it a deep, rich color and intense flavor. The calamari and its ink create a briny, sea-infused dish that is both unique and delicious. Made with simple ingredients and no broth, this risotto highlights the natural taste of the seafood.",
        "ingredients": [
            "6 cups water",
            "4 tablespoons olive oil",
            "1 medium onion, finely chopped",
            "1 garlic clove, finely chopped",
            "12 ounces calamari (squid), cut into 1/2-inch rings and tentacles halved through the base",
            "Salt and freshly ground black pepper",
            "1 cup dry white wine",
            "2 cups medium-grain rice, such as Arborio, Carnaroli, or Vialone Nano",
            "1 to 2 teaspoons squid or cuttlefish ink (optional)",
            "1 to 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "In a medium saucepan, bring the water to a simmer over medium heat, then lower the heat so that it just keeps the water hot.",
            "Pour 4 tablespoons oil in a wide heavy saucepan. Add the onion and cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until tender and golden, about 10 minutes. Add the calamari, and salt and pepper to taste. Cover the pan and cook 10 minutes. Add the wine and cook 1 minute more.",
            "Add the rice and cook, stir with a wooden spoon, until hot, about 2 minutes. Add 1/2 cup of the hot water and stir until the liquid is absorbed. Continue adding the water 1/2 cup at a time, stirring after each addition. Adjust the heat so that the liquid simmers rapidly but the rice does not stick to the pan. Halfway through the cooking, stir in the squid ink, if using, and salt to taste.",
            "Use only as much of the water as needed until the rice becomes tender yet firm to the bite and the risotto is creamy. When you think it may be done, taste a few grains. If not ready, test again in a minute or so. Cooking time is 18 to 20 minutes.",
            "Remove risotto pan from the heat. Stir in the oil until blended. Serve immediately."
