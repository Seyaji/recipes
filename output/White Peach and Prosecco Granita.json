        "introduction": "The White Peach and Prosecco Granita is a refreshing dessert inspired by the classic Bellini cocktail, originating from Venice. This granita combines the sweetness of white peaches with the effervescence of prosecco, resulting in a perfect end to any summer meal.",
        "ingredients": [
            "5 medium ripe white peaches, peeled and cut into chunks",
            "1/2 cup superfine sugar",
            "2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, or to taste",
            "1 cup prosecco or other dry sparkling white wine"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Place a 13 × 9 × 2–inch pan in the freezer to chill for at least 15 minutes. In a blender or food processor, combine the peaches, superfine sugar, and lemon juice. Blend or process until the sugar is completely dissolved. Stir in the wine.",
            "Remove the chilled pan from the freezer and pour the mixture into the pan. Place the pan in the freezer for 30 minutes or until a 1-inch border of ice crystals forms around the edges. Stir the ice crystals into the center of the mixture. Return the pan to the freezer and continue freezing, stirring every 30 minutes, until all of the liquid is frozen, about 2 to 2 1/2 hours. Serve immediately, or scrape the mixture into a plastic container, cover, and store in the freezer for up to 24 hours.",
            "Remove from the freezer to soften about 15 minutes before serving, if necessary."
