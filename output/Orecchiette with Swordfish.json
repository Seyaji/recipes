  "introduction": "Orecchiette with Swordfish is a delightful Sicilian pasta dish where tender fish meets the rich flavors of tomatoes and eggplant. What's special about this Italian classic is its unexpected finishing touch of cheese, adding a creamy richness to the ensemble of ingredients.",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 large or 2 small eggplants (about 1 1/2 pounds)",
    "Coarse salt",
    "Corn or other vegetable oil for frying",
    "3 tablespoons olive oil",
    "1 large garlic clove, very finely chopped",
    "2 green onions, finely chopped",
    "8 ounces swordfish or other meaty fish steak (about 1/2 inch thick), skin removed and cut into 1/2-inch pieces",
    "Freshly ground black pepper to taste",
    "2 tablespoons white wine vinegar",
    "2 cups peeled, seeded, and chopped fresh tomatoes or chopped canned imported Italian tomatoes with their juice",
    "1 teaspoon fresh oregano leaves, chopped, or a pinch of dried oregano",
    "1 pound fresh orecchiette or cavatelli",
    "1/3 cup freshly grated Pecorino Romano"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Cut the eggplant into 1-inch dice. Place the pieces in a colander set over a plate and sprinkle generously with salt. Let stand 30 minutes to 1 hour. Quickly rinse the eggplant pieces. Place the pieces on paper towels and squeeze until dry.",
    "In a large deep skillet over medium heat, heat about 1/2 inch of oil. To test the oil, carefully place a small piece of eggplant in it. If it sizzles and cooks rapidly, add enough eggplant to make a single layer. Do not crowd the pan. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the eggplant is crisp and browned, about 5 minutes. Remove the pieces with a slotted spoon. Drain well on paper towels. Repeat with the remaining eggplant. Set aside.",
    "In a medium skillet over medium heat, cook the olive oil with the garlic and green onions for 30 seconds. Add the fish and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the fish is no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Add the vinegar and cook for 1 minute. Add the tomatoes and oregano. Bring to a simmer and cook for 15 minutes, or until slightly thickened.",
    "Meanwhile, bring a large pot of cold water to a boil. Add salt to taste and the pasta. Cook, stirring occasionally, until al dente, tender yet firm to the bite. Drain well.",
    "In a large heated serving bowl, combine the pasta, sauce, and eggplant. Toss well. Stir in the cheese. Serve hot."

  "variations": [
    "Tuna or shark can be substituted for the swordfish.",
    "If preferred, omit the step of salting the eggplant to remove bitter juices."
