        "introduction": "Raisins and vinegar give a delicious sweet-and-sour flavor to fish in this Venetian classic. Be sure to make this recipe at least a day before you plan to serve it so that the flavors can mellow. Small portions are excellent as an appetizer. Whole trout or mackerel can be substituted for the sardines, or try sole fillets. In Venice, Sarde in Saor is often served with grilled white polenta.",
        "ingredients": [
            "8 tablespoons olive oil",
            "3 onions (about 1 pound), sliced 1⁄2 inch thick",
            "1 cup dry white wine",
            "1 cup white wine vinegar",
            "2 tablespoons pine nuts",
            "2 tablespoons raisins",
            "2 pounds sardines, cleaned"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Pour 4 tablespoons of oil into a large heavy skillet. Add the onions and cook over medium-low heat until very tender, about 20 minutes. Stir frequently and watch carefully so that the onions do not brown. Add a tablespoon or two of water if needed to prevent the onions from coloring.",
            "Add 1⁄2 cup of wine, 1⁄2 cup of vinegar, the raisins, and the pine nuts. Bring to a simmer and cook 1 minute. Remove from the heat.",
            "In another skillet, heat the remaining 4 tablespoons oil over medium heat. Add the sardines and cook until just opaque in the center, about 2 to 3 minutes per side. Arrange the sardines in a single layer on a large platter. Pour on the remaining wine and vinegar.",
            "Spread the onion mixture over the fish. Cover and refrigerate 1 to 2 days to allow the flavors to mellow. Serve at cool room temperature."

        "variations": [
            "Whole trout or mackerel can be substituted for the sardines.",
            "Sole fillets can also be used in place of sardines."
