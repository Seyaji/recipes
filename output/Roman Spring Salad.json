  "introduction": "Roman Spring Salad, also known as Insalata di Puntarella, is a delightful dish that announces the arrival of spring. It traditionally features puntarella, a vegetable part of the endive family, known for its refreshing bitterness. Due to its rarity in the United States, alternatives such as frisée or Belgian endive can be used. This salad is well-loved for its zesty anchovy and garlic dressing that perfectly complements the bitter greens.",
  "ingredients": [
    "8 cups frisée or 4 medium Belgian endive",
    "6 anchovy fillets, chopped",
    "1 small garlic clove, very finely chopped",
    "Salt",
    "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil",
    "1 to 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar",
    "Freshly ground black pepper"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "1. Trim the frisée or endive, discarding the outer leaves and any that are bruised. Wash the vegetable in several changes of cool water. Dry very well. Tear the frisée, if using, into bite-size pieces. Cut the endive crosswise into narrow strips.",
    "2. In a large salad bowl, mash the anchovy fillets, garlic, and a pinch of salt with a fork to form a smooth paste. Whisk in the oil and vinegar.",
    "3. Add the vegetable and toss well. Add pepper to taste. Season to taste. Serve immediately."
