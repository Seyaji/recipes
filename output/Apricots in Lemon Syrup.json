  "introduction": "Capture the essence of summer with apricots poached in a zesty lemon syrup. This dish takes less-than-perfect apricots and elevates them with a tangy, sweet infusion, making for a refreshing dessert that pairs beautifully with amaretto-flavored whipped cream.",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 cup cold water",
    "1/4 cup sugar, or to taste",
    "2 (2-inch) strips lemon zest",
    "2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice",
    "1 pound apricots (about 8)"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "In a saucepan or skillet large enough to hold the apricot halves in a single layer, combine the water, sugar, zest, and juice. Bring to a simmer over medium-low heat and cook, swirling the pan once or twice, for 10 minutes.",
    "Following the line on the apricots, cut them in half and remove the pits. Place the halves in the simmering syrup. Cook, turning once, until the fruit is tender, about 5 minutes.",
    "Let the apricots cool briefly in the syrup, then cover and store in the refrigerator. Serve chilled."
