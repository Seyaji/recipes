  "introduction": "Zucchini and Basil Frittata is a delightful way to use up fresh zucchini when they're in abundance. This simple yet flavorful dish combines the mild taste of zucchini with the aromatic essence of fresh basil, all enveloped in tender, fluffy eggs. Paired with a fresh tomato salad, it makes a perfect meal for any time of the day.",
  "ingredients": [
    "3 tablespoons olive oil",
    "2 to 3 small zucchini (about 1 pound), scrubbed and sliced",
    "8 large eggs",
    "1/4 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano",
    "6 fresh basil leaves, stacked and sliced into thin ribbons",
    "Salt and freshly ground black pepper"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "In a 9-inch nonstick skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the zucchini and cook, turning the pieces occasionally, until the zucchini are nicely browned, about 12 minutes.",
    "In a large bowl, beat the eggs, cheese, basil, and salt and pepper to taste. Lower the heat to medium. Pour the mixture over the zucchini. Lift the edges of the frittata as it sets to allow the uncooked egg to reach the surface of the pan. Cook until the eggs are just set but still moist in the center and the frittata is lightly browned on the bottom, about 5 to 10 minutes.",
    "Slide the frittata onto a plate, then invert the skillet over the plate. Quickly flip both the plate and skillet so that the frittata is cooked-side up. Cook until just set in the center, about 5 minutes more. Or, if you prefer not to flip it, slide the skillet under the broiler 3 to 5 minutes or until set to taste. Serve hot or at room temperature.",
    "Slide the frittata onto a serving dish and cut into wedges. Serve hot or refrigerate and serve cold."
