        "introduction": "Pork Loin with Lemon is a sublime dish that melds the zestiness of lemon with the rich flavor of pork. This dish, perfect for a Sunday dinner, is beautifully paired with slow-cooked cannellini beans and a green vegetable like broccoli or brussels sprouts. With the right preparation, it turns into a fine culinary delight.",
        "ingredients": [
            "1 center-cut boneless pork loin roast (about 3 pounds)",
            "1 teaspoon grated lemon zest",
            "2 garlic cloves, finely chopped",
            "2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley",
            "2 tablespoons olive oil",
            "Salt and freshly ground black pepper",
            "1/2 cup dry white wine"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Place a rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 425°F. Oil a roasting pan just large enough to hold the meat.",
            "In a small bowl, mix together the lemon zest, garlic, parsley, oil, and salt and pepper to taste.",
            "Pat the meat dry with paper towels. To butterfly the pork, place it on a cutting board. With a long sharp knife such as a boning knife or chef's knife, cut the pork almost in half lengthwise, stopping about 3/4 inch from one long side. Open the meat like a book. Spread the lemon and garlic mixture over the side of the meat. Roll up the pork from one long side to the other like a sausage and tie it with kitchen string at 2-inch intervals. Sprinkle the outside with salt and pepper.",
            "Place the meat fat-side up in the prepared pan. Roast 20 minutes. Reduce the heat to 350°F. Roast 40 minutes more. Add the wine and roast 15 to 30 minutes longer, or until the temperature on an instant-read thermometer reaches 150°F.",
            "Transfer the roast to a cutting board. Cover the meat loosely with foil. Let rest 10 minutes before slicing. Place the pan on the stove over medium heat and reduce the pan juices slightly. Slice the pork and transfer it to a serving platter. Pour the juices over the meat. Serve hot."
