        "introduction": "Green Beans with Hazelnuts is a delightful and elegant side dish that combines the crisp freshness of green beans with the rich, nutty flavor of hazelnuts. This dish can also be made using walnuts or almonds for a different twist on the flavors.",
        "ingredients": [
            "1 pound green beans",
            "Salt",
            "3 tablespoons unsalted butter",
            "1/3 cup chopped hazelnuts"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "1. Snap off the stem ends of the green beans. Bring about 2 quarts of water to a boil in a large saucepan. Add the beans and salt to taste. Cook uncovered until the beans are crisp-tender, 4 to 5 minutes.",
            "2. Drain the beans well and pat them dry. (If you are not using them immediately, cool them under cold running water. Wrap the beans in a kitchen towel and leave at room temperature up to 3 hours.)",
            "3. Just before serving, heat the butter in a large pan. Add the hazelnuts and cook, stirring often, until the nuts are lightly toasted and the butter is lightly browned, about 3 minutes.",
            "4. Add the beans and a pinch of salt. Cook, stirring often, until heated, 2 to 3 minutes. Serve immediately."
