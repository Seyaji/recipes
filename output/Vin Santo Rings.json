  "introduction": "Vin Santo Rings, or Ciambelline al Vin Santo, are delightful Tuscan biscuits made distinct by the inclusion of vin santo, a dry dessert wine that imparts a subtle and unique wine flavor. These tender and crumbly cookies, crafted with olive oil rather than eggs or butter, offer a delicate and sophisticated taste experience, making them perfect for a refined dessert or a special treat with a cup of coffee.",
  "ingredients": [
    "2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour",
    "1/2 cup sugar",
    "1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil",
    "1/2 cup vin santo"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Have ready 2 large ungreased baking sheets.",
    "2. In a large bowl, with a wooden spoon, combine the flour and sugar. Add the oil and wine and stir until smooth and well blended. Shape the dough into a ball.",
    "3. Divide the dough into 6 sections. Cut one section into 8 pieces. Roll each piece between your palms into a 4 x 1/2–inch log. Shape the log into a ring, pinching the edges together to seal. Repeat with the remaining dough, placing the rings 1 inch apart on the baking sheets.",
    "4. Have ready 2 wire cooling racks. Bake the rings 20 minutes or until golden brown.",
    "5. Transfer the baking sheets to the racks. Let the cookies cool 5 minutes on the baking sheets, then transfer them to the wire racks to cool completely. Store in an airtight container up to 2 weeks."
