Remove the fish with a slotted spoon. Let cool slightly. With your fingers, remove any skin and bones. Cut the fish into bite-size pieces.",

    "3. Add the tomatoes and red pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is thick, 20 to 30 minutes.",
    "4. Add the fish, olives, and capers and cook 10 minutes. Taste for salt.",
    "5. Bring at least 4 quarts of water to a boil in a large pot. Add 2 tablespoons of salt, then the pasta. Stir well, gently pushing the pasta down until it is completely covered with water. Cook, stirring frequently, until the pasta is al dente, tender yet still firm to the bite. Drain the pasta, reserving a little of the cooking water.",
    "6. Add the pasta to the pan with the sauce. Toss well over medium heat, adding a little of the cooking water if needed. Drizzle with a little extra-virgin olive oil and serve immediately."
