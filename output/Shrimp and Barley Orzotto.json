  "titleAlternative": "Orzotto di Gamberi",
  "yield": "Makes 4 servings",
  "introduction": "Shrimp and Barley Orzotto combines the hearty texture of barley with the delicacy of shrimp. In the northern region of Italy, specifically Friuliâ€“Venezia Giulia, orzo refers to barley, not pasta. When cooked in the style of risotto, this comforting dish becomes 'orzotto,' a flavorful and satisfying meal.",
  "ingredients": [
    "3 cups Chicken Broth, vegetable broth, or water",
    "2 tablespoons unsalted butter",
    "1 tablespoon olive oil",
    "1 small onion, finely chopped",
    "1 small carrot, finely chopped",
    "1/2 cup finely chopped celery",
    "1 garlic clove, minced",
    "6 ounces (2/3 cup) pearl barley, rinsed and drained",
    "Salt and freshly ground black pepper",
    "8 ounces shrimp, shelled and deveined",
    "2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Prepare the broth, if necessary. In a medium saucepan, melt the butter with the oil over medium heat. Add the onion, carrot, celery, and garlic and cook until golden, about 10 minutes.",
    "Add the barley to the vegetables in the skillet and stir well. Add the broth, 1 teaspoon salt, and pepper to taste. Bring to a simmer and reduce the heat. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, 30 to 40 minutes or until the barley is tender. Add a little water if the mixture becomes dry.",
    "Meanwhile, chop the shrimp and stir them and the parsley into the barley mixture. Cook until the shrimp are just pink, 2 to 3 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning. Serve immediately."
