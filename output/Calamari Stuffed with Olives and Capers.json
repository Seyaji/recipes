        "introduction": "Calamari, also known as squid, are a versatile seafood option that can toughen quickly when heated but become wonderfully tender when cooked slowly in liquid. This recipe for Calamari Stuffed with Olives and Capers utilizes a delicious stuffing and a slow-simmering sauce to achieve a great texture and flavor.",
        "ingredients": {
            "main": [
                "2 1/2 pounds cleaned large calamari (squid), about 6 to 8 inches long",
                "2 tablespoons olive oil",
                "1 garlic clove, finely chopped",
                "1/2 cup plain bread crumbs",
                "2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley",
                "2 tablespoons chopped Gaeta or other mild black olives",
                "2 tablespoons chopped, rinsed, and drained capers",
                "1/2 teaspoon dried oregano, crumbled",
                "Salt and freshly ground black pepper"
            ],
            "sauce": [
                "1/4 cup olive oil",
                "1/2 cup dry red wine",
                "2 cups chopped canned peeled tomatoes with their juice",
                "1 large garlic clove, lightly crushed",
                "Pinch of crushed red pepper",
                "Salt"

        "instructions": [
            "Make a small slit at the pointed end of each calamari. Rinse thoroughly, letting the water run through the body sac. Drain and pat dry. Separate the bodies from the tentacles with a knife. Set the bodies aside. Chop the tentacles either with a large knife or in a food processor.",
            "Pour the 2 tablespoons oil into a medium skillet. Add the garlic. Cook over medium heat until the garlic begins to turn golden, about 1 minute. Stir in the tentacles. Cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Add the bread crumbs, parsley, olives, capers, and oregano. Add salt and pepper to taste. Remove from the heat and let cool.",
            "With a small spoon, stuff the bread crumb mixture loosely into the calamari bodies, filling them only halfway. Secure the calamari with wooden toothpicks.",
            "Choose a skillet large enough to hold all of the calamari in a single layer. Pour in the 1/4 cup oil and heat over medium heat. Add the calamari and cook, turning them with tongs, until they are just opaque, about 2 minutes per side.",
            "Add the wine and bring to a simmer. Stir in the tomatoes, garlic, crushed red pepper, and salt to taste. Bring to a simmer. Partially cover the pan and cook, turning the calamari occasionally, until they are very tender, 50 to 60 minutes. Add a little water if the sauce becomes too thick. Serve hot."
