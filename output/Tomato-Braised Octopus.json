    "introduction": "Tomato-Braised Octopus is a flavorful and tender dish where octopus is simmered in a rich tomato sauce. The traditional method of tenderizing octopus has evolved over time, making it easier to achieve a tender texture. This Neapolitan-inspired recipe ensures a delicious and satisfying meal, especially when served with crusty bread to soak up the delectable sauce.",
    "ingredients": [
        "4 to 8 baby octopus, about 6 ounces each, or 1 large octopus, about 2½ pounds",
        "¼ cup olive oil",
        "2 cups chopped canned peeled tomatoes with their juice",
        "4 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley",
        "2 large garlic cloves, finely chopped",
        "Pinch of crushed red pepper",
        "Salt"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "1. Check the base of the octopus to see if the hard, round beak has been removed. Squeeze it out if necessary. Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil. Add the octopus and simmer until tender when pierced with a knife, 30 to 60 minutes. Drain and dry the octopus, reserving some of the cooking liquid. Cut large octopus into bite-size pieces.",
        "2. In a large heavy saucepan, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the octopus, tomatoes, 3 tablespoons of the parsley, the garlic, red pepper, and salt to taste. Stir to combine. Bring the sauce to a simmer. Cover the pot and cook over very low heat, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes. Add a little of the reserved liquid if the sauce becomes too dry.",
        "3. Uncover and cook 15 minutes more, or until the sauce is thick. Serve hot."
