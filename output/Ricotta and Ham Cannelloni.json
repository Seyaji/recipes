  "instructions": [
    "Prepare the pasta and sauce. Lay out some lint-free kitchen towels on a flat surface. Have ready a large bowl of cold water. Bring about 4 quarts of water to a boil. Add salt to taste. Add the pasta squares a few pieces at a time. Cook the pasta until tender but slightly underdone. Scoop the pasta out of the water and place it in the cold water. When cool enough to handle, lay the pasta sheets out flat on the towels, which can be stacked one on top of the other. Continue cooking and cooling the remaining pasta in the same way.",
    "In a large bowl, combine the mozzarella, ricotta, prosciutto, egg, and 1/2 cup of the Parmigiano. Mix well and add salt and pepper to taste.",
    "Spoon a thin layer of sauce in the bottom of a large baking dish. Spread about 2 tablespoons of the filling on one end of each pasta square. Roll up the pasta, starting with the filled end, and place the rolls seamside down in the prepared pan.",
    "Spoon a thin layer of sauce over the pasta. Sprinkle with the remaining Parmigiano.",
    "Place a rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 375°F. Bake 30 minutes or until the sauce is bubbling and the cheeses are melted. Serve hot."
