  "introduction": "Romans make rice balls filled with cheese that stretch into strings like telephone wires when pulled apart. Named suppli', these delicious snacks are enjoyed across Rome as a delightful treat, often enjoyed before dinner.",
  "ingredients": [
    "5 cups chicken broth",
    "2 cups medium-grain rice, such as Arborio, Carnaroli, or Vialone Nano",
    "4 tablespoons unsalted butter",
    "Salt to taste",
    "3 large eggs, beaten",
    "1 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano",
    "2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley",
    "Pinch of freshly grated nutmeg",
    "6 ounces mozzarella, cut into small dice",
    "3 large eggs, beaten (to assemble)",
    "2 cups plain dried bread crumbs",
    "1 cup all-purpose flour",
    "Vegetable oil for frying"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Bring the broth to a boil in a large pot. Stir in the rice, butter, and salt. Cover and reduce the heat to low. Cook until the rice is tender, about 18 minutes.",
    "Remove the rice from the heat. Let cool slightly, then stir in the three beaten eggs, grated cheese, parsley, and nutmeg.",
    "To assemble, beat the other three eggs in a shallow plate until foamy. Spread the bread crumbs on one sheet of wax paper and the flour on another. Place a cake rack over a baking sheet.",
    "Dip your hands in cool water to prevent the rice from sticking. Scoop up about 1/4 cup of the rice mixture and place it in the palm of one hand. Poke a shallow hole in the center of the rice. Press a bit of the mozzarella in the hole. Cup your hand slightly, molding the rice over the filling to enclose it completely. Add a little more rice if necessary to cover the filling completely. Very gently squeeze the rice to compact it and form a ball.",
    "Carefully roll the rice ball in the flour, then in the eggs to coat it completely. Roll the ball in the bread crumbs, being sure not to leave any spots uncovered. Place the rice ball on a rack to dry.",
    "Continue making rice balls with the remaining ingredients. Let the rice balls dry on the rack for 30 minutes.",
    "Line a tray with paper towels; set the oven at the lowest temperature. Pour about 3 inches of oil into an electric deep fryer or a deep heavy saucepan. Heat the oil until the temperature reaches 375Â°F on a deep-frying thermometer or when a drop of egg white sizzles when it is added to the oil.",
    "Carefully place the rice balls a few at a time in the hot oil. Do not crowd the pan. Cook until golden brown and crisp all over, 3 to 4 minutes. With a slotted spoon or strainer, transfer the rice balls to the paper towels to drain. Repeat with the remaining rice balls. Keep the cooked rice balls in the warm oven while you fry the remainder. Serve hot or warm."
