        "ingredients": [
            "1½ pounds cleaned large calamari (squid), about 6 to 8 inches long",
            "1 cup plain dry bread crumbs",
            "3 garlic cloves, finely chopped",
            "2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley",
            "Salt and freshly ground black pepper",
            "5 tablespoons olive oil",
            "1 large onion, finely chopped",
            "2 cups peeled, seeded, and chopped tomatoes",
            "½ cup dry white wine"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "1. Make a small slit at the pointed end of each calamari. Rinse thoroughly, letting the water run through the body sac. Drain and pat dry. Finely chop the tentacles.",
            "2. In a bowl, combine the tentacles, bread crumbs, garlic, parsley, and salt and pepper to taste. Add 2 to 3 tablespoons olive oil or enough to moisten the mixture. With a small spoon, stuff the bread crumb mixture loosely into the calamari, filling them only halfway. Secure the calamari with wooden toothpicks.",
            "3. Pour the remaining 3 tablespoons oil into a large skillet. Add the onion. Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until tender, about 10 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes, wine, and salt and pepper to taste. Bring to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low. Add the calamari. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, 50 to 60 minutes, or until the calamari are tender when pierced with a fork. Serve hot."
