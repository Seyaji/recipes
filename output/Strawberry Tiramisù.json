        "introduction": "This Strawberry Tiramisù is a delightful twist on the classic Italian dessert, replacing coffee with the bright, fresh flavor of strawberries. Infused with a hint of orange and a splash of maraschino liqueur, this dessert is perfect for those who favor fruit-based desserts.",
        "ingredients": [
            "3 pints strawberries, washed and hulled",
            "1/2 cup orange juice",
            "1/4 cup maraschino, crème di cassis, or orange liqueur",
            "1/4 cup sugar",
            "1 cup chilled heavy or whipping cream",
            "8 ounces mascarpone",
            "24 savoiardi (Italian lady fingers)"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Set aside 2 cups of the best-looking strawberries for garnish. Chop the remainder. In a large bowl, combine the strawberries with the orange juice, liqueur, and sugar. Let stand at room temperature 1 hour.",
            "Meanwhile, place a large bowl and the beaters of an electric mixer in the refrigerator. When ready, remove the bowl and beaters from the refrigerator. Pour the cream into the bowl and whip the cream at high speed until it holds its shape softly when the beaters are lifted, about 4 minutes. With a flexible spatula, gently fold in the mascarpone.",
            "Make a layer of ladyfingers in a 9 × 2–inch square or round serving dish. Spoon on half of the strawberries and their juice. Spread half of the mascarpone cream over the berries.",
            "Repeat with a second layer of ladyfingers, strawberries, and cream, spreading the cream smooth with a spatula. Cover and refrigerate 3 to 4 hours or overnight so that the flavors can meld.",
            "Just before serving, slice the remaining strawberries and arrange them in rows on top."
