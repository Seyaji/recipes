  "ingredients": [
    "5 cups Chicken Broth",
    "4 tablespoons unsalted butter",
    "1 small onion, finely chopped",
    "2 cups medium-grain rice, such as Arborio, Carnaroli, or Vialone Nano",
    "Salt and freshly ground black pepper",
    "1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice",
    "1 teaspoon grated lemon zest",
    "1/2 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Prepare the broth, if necessary. Bring the broth to a simmer over medium heat, then lower the heat so that it just keeps the broth hot. In a wide heavy saucepan, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring often until golden, about 10 minutes.",
    "Add the rice and stir with a wooden spoon until hot, about 2 minutes. Add 1/2 cup of the hot broth and stir until the liquid is absorbed.",
    "Continue adding the broth 1/2 cup at a time, stirring after each addition. Adjust the heat so that the liquid simmers rapidly but the rice does not stick to the pan. About halfway through the cooking time, season with salt and pepper.",
    "Use only as much of the broth as needed until the rice becomes tender yet firm to the bite and the risotto is creamy. When you think it may be done, taste a few grains. If not ready, test again in a minute or so. If the broth runs out before the rice is tender, use hot water. Cooking time will be 18 to 20 minutes.",
    "Remove the risotto pan from the heat. Add the lemon juice and zest, the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter, and the cheese. Stir until the butter and cheese are melted and creamy. Taste for seasoning. Serve immediately."
