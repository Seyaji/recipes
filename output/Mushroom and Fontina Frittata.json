        "introduction": "Mushroom and Fontina Frittata is a delightful Italian-inspired dish that showcases the aromatic and rich flavors of Fontina Valle d'Aosta cheese combined with the earthiness of mushrooms. This dish is quick to prepare and perfect for any meal of the day.",
        "ingredients": [
            "3 tablespoons unsalted butter",
            "8 ounces mushrooms, halved or quartered if large",
            "Salt and freshly ground black pepper",
            "8 large eggs",
            "2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley",
            "4 ounces Fontina Valle d'Aosta, cut into slices"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "In a 9-inch non-stick skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the mushrooms and salt and pepper to taste. Cook, stirring often, until the mushrooms are lightly browned, about 10 minutes.",
            "In a large bowl, beat the eggs with the parsley and salt and pepper to taste. Lower the heat to medium. Pour the mixture over the mushrooms. Lift the edges of the frittata as it sets to allow the uncooked egg to reach the surface of the pan. Cover and cook until the eggs are just set but still moist in the center and the frittata is lightly browned on the bottom, about 5 to 10 minutes.",
            "Place the slices of cheese on top. Slide the skillet under the broiler and cook 1 to 3 minutes or until the cheese has melted and the eggs are set to taste. Or, if you prefer, cover the pan and cook 3 to 5 minutes, until the cheese is melted and the eggs are set to taste.",
            "Slide the frittata onto a serving plate. Serve hot."
