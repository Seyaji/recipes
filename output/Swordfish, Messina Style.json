        "ingredients": [
            "1 pound boiling potatoes",
            "2 tablespoons olive oil",
            "1 large onion, chopped",
            "1/2 cup pitted black olives, coarsely chopped",
            "2 tablespoons capers, rinsed and drained",
            "2 cups peeled, seeded, and chopped tomatoes, or drained and chopped canned tomatoes",

        "instructions": [
            "Scrub the potatoes and place them in a saucepan with cold water to cover. Bring the water to a boil and cook until the potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes. Drain, let cool a little, then peel the potatoes. Thinly slice them.",
            "Pour the oil into a large saucepan. Add the onion and cook, stirring frequently, over medium heat until tender, about 10 minutes. Stir in the olives, capers, and tomatoes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Cook until thickened slightly, about 15 minutes. Stir in the parsley.",
            "Place a rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 425Â°F. Spoon half the sauce into a baking pan large enough to hold the fish in a single layer.
