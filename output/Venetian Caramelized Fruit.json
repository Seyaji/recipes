    "introduction": "Venetian Caramelized Fruit is a delightful treat where fruits are skewered and coated with a rich, candy-like caramel. This dessert offers a wonderful blend of sweet, tangy, and chewy textures. Ideal for making on dry days, as humidity affects the caramel's hardening, these elegant skewers showcase the charm of Venetian sweets.",
    "ingredients": [
      "1 tangerine or clementine, peeled, divided into sections",
      "8 small strawberries, hulled",
      "8 seedless grapes",
      "8 pitted dates",
      "1 cup sugar",
      "1/2 cup light corn syrup",
      "1/4 cup water"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Thread the fruit pieces alternately on each of eight 6-inch wood skewers. Set a wire cooling rack on top of a tray.",
      "In a skillet large enough to fit the skewers into lengthwise, combine the sugar, corn syrup, and water. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally until the sugar is completely dissolved, about 3 minutes. When the mixture begins to boil, stop stirring and cook until the syrup starts to brown around the edges. Then gently swirl the pan over the heat until the syrup is an even golden brown, about 2 minutes more.",
      "Remove the pan from the heat. Using tongs, quickly dip each skewer in the syrup, turning to coat the fruit lightly but thoroughly. Let the excess syrup drain back into the pan. Place the skewers on the rack to cool. (If the syrup in the pan hardens before all the skewers have been dipped, reheat it gently.) Serve at room temperature within 2 hours."
