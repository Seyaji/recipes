  "instructions": [
    "1. Place a rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 450Â°F. Trim off the beet greens and set aside. Scrub the beets and wrap them in a large sheet of aluminum foil, sealing tightly. Place the package on a baking sheet. Bake for 45 to 75 minutes, depending on size, or until the beets feel tender when pierced through the foil with a sharp knife. Let the beets cool in the foil. Unwrap the foil, then peel and chop the beets.",
    "2. Wash the greens well and remove the tough stems. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the greens and salt to taste. Cook 5 minutes or until the greens are almost tender. Drain the greens and cool them under running water. Coarsely chop the greens.",
    "3. Pour the oil into a skillet large enough to hold all of the pasta and vegetables. Add the garlic. Cook over medium heat until the garlic is golden, about 2 minutes. Add the beets and greens and a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, about 5 minutes or until the vegetables are heated through.",
    "4. Bring at least 4 quarts of water to a boil in a large pot. Add 2 tablespoons of salt, then the pasta. Stir well. Cook over high heat, stirring frequently, until the pasta is al dente, tender yet firm to the bite.",
    "5. Drain the pasta, reserving some of the cooking water. Add the pasta to the skillet with the beets. Add some of the cooking water and cook, stirring the pasta constantly, until it is evenly colored, about 1 minute. Add the cheese and stir again. Serve immediately with a generous sprinkling of freshly ground black pepper."
