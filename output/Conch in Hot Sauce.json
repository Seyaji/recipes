    "introduction": "Conch in Hot Sauce is a captivating seafood dish that brings a spicy Italian flair to the table. Known in Italian as scungilli, this dish infuses the tender conch meat with a luscious tomato and white wine sauce, complemented by a hint of red pepper heat. Traditionally enjoyed over hard biscuits called freselle, this dish is equally delightful with toasted Italian bread, making for a delightful and spicy seafood experience.",
    "ingredients": [
      "2 pounds partially cooked fresh or frozen conch or whelk meat (scungilli)",
      "1/3 cup olive oil",
      "2 large garlic cloves, finely chopped",
      "Pinch of crushed red pepper, or to taste",
      "2 (28-ounce) cans peeled tomatoes, chopped",
      "1 cup dry white wine",
      "Salt",
      "2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley",
      "Italian bread slices, toasted"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "If using fresh conch, go to step 2. If the conch are frozen, place them in a bowl with cold water to cover. Put the bowl in the refrigerator several hours or overnight, changing the water occasionally.",
      "Begin cutting the conch into 1/4-inch slices. When you come to a dark tube filled with a spongy matter, pull or cut it out and discard it, as it can be gritty. There is another tube on the outside of the body that does not need to be removed. Rinse the slices well and pat them dry.",
      "Pour the oil into a large saucepan. Add the garlic and crushed red pepper. Cook over medium heat until the garlic is golden, about 2 minutes. Add the tomatoes and their juice, the wine, and salt to taste. Bring to a simmer. Cook 15 minutes on low heat, stirring occasionally.",
      "Add the conch and bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the conch is tender and the sauce is thickened, about 30 minutes. If the sauce becomes too thick, stir in a little water. Taste for seasoning, adding more pepper, if desired. Stir in the parsley.",
      "Place slices of toasted Italian bread in the bottom of 4 pasta bowls. Spoon on the conch and serve immediately."
