  "ingredients": [
    "1 medium orange",
    "1 medium lemon",
    "2 whole fish such as red snapper or sea bass (about 2 pounds each), cleaned with heads and tails intact",
    "2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme leaves",
    "2 tablespoons olive oil",
    "Salt and freshly ground black pepper",
    "1/2 cup dry white wine",
    "1 orange and 1 lemon, sliced, for garnish"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "With a swivel-blade vegetable peeler, remove half of the zest from the orange and lemon skin. Stack the pieces and cut them into narrow strips. Squeeze the fruits to extract the juice.",
    "Place a rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Oil a baking pan large enough to hold the fish in a single layer.",
    "Rinse the fish well and pat dry. Place the fish in the pan and stuff the cavity with the thyme and half the zest. Sprinkle inside and out with the oil and salt and pepper to taste. Pour the wine, juice, and remaining zest over the fish.",
    "Bake, basting once or twice with the pan juices, about 8 to 10 minutes per inch of thickness at the widest point of the fish, or until the flesh is opaque when cut with a small sharp knife near the bone. Serve hot, garnished with orange and lemon slices."
