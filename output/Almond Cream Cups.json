  "introduction": "A classic Italian dessert that once graced the tables of many Italian restaurants, Almond Cream Cups are a delightful treat reminiscent of the timeless tiramis√π. Known for their ease of preparation and delicious taste, these cups can be elegantly presented in parfait glasses or ramekins for a special touch. The maraschino cherries add a splash of color, but you can omit them if you prefer.",
  "ingredients": [
    "2 cups chilled heavy or whipping cream",
    "1/2 cup confectioners' sugar",
    "2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract",
    "1/2 teaspoon almond extract",
    "2 egg whites, at room temperature",
    "Pinch of salt",
    "8 maraschino cherries, drained and chopped (optional)",
    "2 tablespoons finely chopped toasted almonds",
    "12 to 16 imported Italian amaretti cookies, finely crushed (about 1 cup crumbs)"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "At least 20 minutes before you are ready to whip the cream, place a large bowl and the beaters of an electric mixer in the refrigerator. Line a muffin tin with 8 pleated paper or foil cupcake liners.",
    "Remove the bowl and beaters from the refrigerator. Pour the cream, sugar, and extracts into the bowl and whip the mixture at high speed until it holds its shape softly when the beaters are lifted, about 4 minutes. Refrigerate the whipped cream.",
    "In a large clean bowl with clean beaters, whip the egg whites with the salt on low speed until foamy. Gradually increase the speed and beat until the whites hold soft peaks when the beaters are lifted. With a flexible spatula, gently fold the whites into the whipped cream.",
    "Set aside 2 tablespoons of the amaretti crumbs. Fold the remaining crumbs, the cherries, and the almonds into the cream mixture. Spoon into the prepared muffin cups. Sprinkle with the reserved amaretti crumbs.",
    "Cover with foil and freeze at least 4 hours or up to overnight. Remove from the refrigerator 15 minutes before serving."
