    "Prepare the broth, if necessary. Then, pour the olive oil into a large pot. Add the celery, carrots, garlic, onion, and herbs. Cook, stirring frequently, over medium heat until the celery and other aromatics are tender and golden, about 20 minutes. Add the tomatoes and cook 10 minutes.",
    "Stir in the beans, remaining vegetables, and salt and pepper to taste. Add the broth and water to just cover. Bring to a simmer. Cook gently, over very low heat, until the vegetables are tender, about 2 hours. Let cool slightly, then if not using right away, store in the refrigerator overnight or up to 2 days.",
    "When ready to serve, pour about 4 cups of the soup into a blender or food processor. Puree the soup, then transfer it to a pot along with the remaining soup. Reheat gently.",
    "Choose a soup tureen or pot large enough to hold the bread and soup. Place a layer of bread slices on the bottom. Spoon on enough of the soup to cover the bread completely. Repeat the layering until all of soup is used and the bread is soaked. Let stand at least 20 minutes. It should be very thick.",
    "Stir the soup to break up the bread. Drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil and sprinkle with the red onion. Serve warm or at room temperature."
