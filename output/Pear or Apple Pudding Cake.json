  "introduction": "This delightful dessert strikes a perfect balance between cake and pudding. By cooking fruit until tender and then baking it with a slightly cakelike topping, this dish can be made with apples, pears, peaches, or plums. Dark rum adds a deep, aromatic touch, but you can also use light rum, cognac, or grappa.",
  "ingredients": [
    "3/4 cup raisins",
    "1/2 cup dark rum, cognac, or grappa",
    "2 tablespoons unsalted butter",
    "8 firm ripe pears or apples, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch slices",
    "1/3 cup sugar",
    "6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled",
    "1/3 cup sugar",
    "1/2 cup all-purpose flour",
    "3 large eggs, separated",
    "2/3 cup whole milk",
    "2 tablespoons dark rum, cognac, or grappa",
    "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract",
    "Pinch of salt",
    "Confectioner's sugar"

  "instructions": [
    "1. In a small bowl, toss together the raisins and rum. Let stand for 30 minutes.",
    "2. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the fruit and sugar. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the fruit is almost tender, about 7 minutes. Add the raisins and rum. Cook 2 minutes more. Remove from the heat.",
    "3. Place a rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Grease a 13 × 9 × 2–inch baking dish. Spoon the fruit mixture into the baking dish.",
    "4. Prepare the topping: In a large bowl, with an electric mixer, beat the butter and sugar until blended, about 3 minutes. Stir in the flour, just to combine.",
    "5. In a medium bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, milk, rum, and vanilla. Stir the egg mixture into the flour mixture until blended.",
    "6. In another large bowl, with clean beaters beat the egg whites with the salt on low speed until foamy. Increase the speed and beat until soft peaks form, about 4 minutes. Gently fold the whites into the rest of the batter. Pour the batter over the fruit in the baking dish and bake 25 minutes or until the top is golden and firm to the touch.",
    "7. Serve warm or at room temperature, sprinkled with confectioner's sugar."
