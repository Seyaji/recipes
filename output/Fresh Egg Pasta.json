  "introduction": "Fresh Egg Pasta, or Pasta al Uovo, is a versatile and timeless classic of Italian cuisine. This all-purpose pasta dough, which can be used for fettuccine, lasagne, and ravioli, is simple to make and immensely rewarding. Though it does require some patience and practice to perfect, the results are well worth the effort. The dough can be made by hand, in a food processor, or with a mixer, and rolled out using a rolling pin or pasta machine. It can be stored at room temperature, refrigerated, or frozen for later use. But remember, the key to great pasta is balancing the flour and eggs for a dough that's neither too sticky nor too dry.",
  "ingredients": [
    "About 2 1/2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour",
    "4 large eggs, beaten",
    "1 teaspoon olive oil (optional, but a good idea, especially for stuffed pastas)"
  ],
  "instructions": {
    "Preparing the Dough by Hand": [
      "Pour the flour into a mound on a countertop or large pasta board. Make a wide hole in the center and pour the eggs and olive oil into it. Stir gradually incorporating the flour from the inside of the hole.",
      "When the dough forms a ball, begin kneading by hand on a lightly floured surface until the dough is smooth, moist, and slightly sticky, about 3 minutes. Remove any hardened scraps and continue kneading until elastic, about 8-10 minutes.",
      "Let the dough rest covered with an inverted bowl for 30 minutes to up to 2 hours at room temperature."
    ],
    "Making the Dough with a Food Processor or Heavy-Duty Mixer": [
      "Pour the eggs and olive oil into the food processor or mixer bowl. With the machine running, add flour one tablespoon at a time until the dough forms a ball. Pinch to test consistency; it should be moist but not sticky.",
      "Knead the dough by hand for 1 minute on a lightly floured surface."
    ],
    "Rolling Out the Dough By Hand": [
      "Lightly dust a surface with flour. Cut the dough into 2 pieces. Shape each into a disk and roll from the center outward, rotating to maintain an even thickness, until desired thinness is reached.",
      "Work quickly to prevent drying out and ensure all pieces are of equal thickness. Cut into desired shapes while still pliable to make various pasta types."
    ],
    "Rolling Out the Dough with a Pasta Machine": [
      "Clamp the pasta machine to a stable surface, set rollers to the widest setting, and dust lightly with flour.",
      "Cut dough into 4-6 pieces. Flatten into disks and feed through the machine. Fold the dough and pass it through again, reducing roller width each time until desired thinness is achieved.",
      "Lay pasta strips on a floured towel to prevent sticking and cut into desired shapes while still soft."
    ],
    "Making Pasta Noodles": [
      "Make the pasta dough as described. Let it dry until slightly leathery but still pliable, about 20 minutes.",
      "Use pasta machine or cut by hand into desired widths and shapes for lasagne, papardelle, fettuccine, tagliatelle, and tagliarini.",
      "Separate strips and dry on a floured surface for about an hour at room temperature."
    ],
    "Storing Fresh Egg Pasta": [
      "To freeze, place strips on a floured baking sheet and freeze until firm. Wrap in plastic wrap or foil and store up to one month.",
      "To dry, place strips on baking sheets covered with lightweight cloth towels. Air dry at room temperature until completely dry and store in plastic bags."
