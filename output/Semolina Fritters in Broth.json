        "introduction": "Semolina Fritters in Broth is a comforting soup made with tender semolina and cheese fritters served in a savory chicken broth. This dish, rooted in Sicilian tradition, is typically enjoyed around Christmas and the New Year. The simplicity of the semolina fritters, lightly fried to golden perfection, pairs wonderfully with the rich and warming broth, making it a perfect dish to savor during colder months.",
        "ingredients": [
            "6 cups homemade Chicken Broth or a mix of half store-bought broth and half water",
            "2 1/2 cups water",
            "1 teaspoon salt",
            "1 cup fine ground semolina",
            "1 large egg, beaten",
            "1 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano",
            "2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley",
            "Freshly ground black pepper",
            "Olive oil"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Prepare the broth, if necessary. Then, in a medium saucepan over medium heat, bring the water to a simmer. Whisk in the semolina and salt. Reduce the heat to low and cook, stirring, until the semolina is thickened, about 2 minutes.",
            "Remove the pot from the heat. Whisk in the egg, cheese, parsley, and pepper to taste.",
            "Line a tray with a piece of plastic wrap. Scrape the semolina mixture onto the plastic and spread it out to a 1/2-inch thickness. Let cool to room temperature, at least 30 minutes. Use immediately or cover with plastic wrap and store in the refrigerator up to 24 hours.",
            "Just before serving the soup, cut the semolina mixture into bite-size pieces. Brush a large non-stick skillet with olive oil and heat the skillet over medium heat. Add enough of the semolina pieces as will fit comfortably in one layer without crowding. Cook until golden brown, about 4 to 5 minutes. Turn the pieces and brown the other side, about 4 to 5 minutes more. Remove the pieces to a plate. Cover with foil and keep warm. Brown the remaining semolina pieces in the same way.",
            "Meanwhile, bring the broth to a simmer. Divide the semolina fritters among 4 bowls. Spoon on the broth. Serve immediately."
