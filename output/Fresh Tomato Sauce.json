  "introduction": "This Fresh Tomato Sauce is unique because it skips the usual sautéing of onions or garlic in olive oil or butter. Instead, the aromatics infuse the tomatoes during a gentle simmer, creating a delicate vegetable flavor. Perfect for fresh pastas or as a light sauce for a frittata.",
