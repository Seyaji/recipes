        "introduction": "Ricotta Pockets, also known as Cassatedde di Santa Ninfa, are delightful turnovers filled with creamy ricotta. Traditionally prepared with goat's milk ricotta in the Sicilian town of Santa Ninfa, these delicious pastries are best enjoyed freshly fried but can also be reheated in an oven. The unique flavor is enhanced by the use of Marsala wine and a touch of chocolate in the filling.",
        "ingredients": [
            "2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour",
            "1/2 cup (1 stick) butter, melted and cooled",
            "1 large egg, plus 1 egg yolk, lightly beaten",
            "1/2 cup sweet or dry Marsala",
            "1 1/2 pounds whole or part-skim ricotta, drained overnight",
            "1/2 cup sugar",
            "2 ounces semisweet chocolate, finely chopped",
            "1 teaspoon grated lemon zest",
            "2 tablespoons butter, melted and cooled",
            "Olive oil for frying",
            "About 1 cup sugar"

        "instructions": [
            "1. Place the flour in a large mixing bowl. Add the melted butter and stir until absorbed. Gradually stir in the eggs and Marsala to form a soft dough. Knead the dough until smooth, about 10 minutes. Wrap the dough in plastic and refrigerate for 30 minutes up to overnight.",
            "2. Pass the ricotta through a fine-mesh strainer or blend it in a food processor until smooth. Stir in the sugar, chocolate, and lemon zest.",
            "3. Cut the dough into quarters. On a lightly floured surface, roll out one piece into a 12 × 12–inch square. Brush with 1 tablespoon of the butter. Roll up the dough into a 12-inch rope and cut into 12 pieces. Place on a plate and refrigerate while you prepare the remaining dough. You should have 48 pieces of dough.",
            "4. Dip both cut sides of one piece of dough lightly in flour. Roll out the piece into a 5- to 6-inch circle. Place about 2 tablespoons of the ricotta filling to one side of the circle. Moisten the edge with water, fold in half, and seal. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling.",
            "5. In a deep saucepan, heat oil to 370°F. Add the dough pieces without crowding. Cook, turning once, until golden brown, about 3 minutes.",
            "6. Remove the pastries with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Fry the remainder in the same way.",
            "7. While still warm, roll the turnovers in granulated sugar. Serve warm or at room temperature."
