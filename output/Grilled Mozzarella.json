  "introduction": "Grilled Mozzarella, or Mozzarella ai Ferri, is a delightful dish that features fresh mozzarella grilled to perfection. The cheese develops a golden crust on the outside while remaining warm and melty on the inside. Ideal for summer lunches, it pairs wonderfully with a salad of arugula, tomatoes, and sweet onions. A nonstick skillet or griddle is crucial for achieving the best results, and the mozzarella must be quite dry, as fresh mozzarella can be very moist.",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 pound fresh mozzarella, cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "If the mozzarella is very moist, lay the slices on paper towels to drain the excess moisture. Refrigerate one hour, turning the slices once.",
    "Place a nonstick skillet over medium heat. When a drop of water flicked onto the skillet bounces and evaporates quickly, the pan is ready.",
    "Place a slice of the mozzarella in the skillet. When it begins to turn brown around the edge, turn it over with a spatula. Cook 1 minute more. Repeat with the remaining slices. Serve hot."
