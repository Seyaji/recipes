    "introduction": "Dora's Baked Figs are a delightful Pugliese treat, stuffed with toasted almonds and infused with the aromatic flavors of fennel seeds and bay leaves. This scrumptious preparation is perfect as an after-dinner delight and pairs wonderfully with a fine dessert wine like Moscato di Pantelleria.",
    "ingredients": [
        "24 moist dried figs (about 1 1/2 pounds), stem ends removed",
        "24 toasted almonds",
        "1 tablespoon fennel seeds",
        "1/4 cup bay leaves"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "1. Place a rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Remove the hard stem ends from each fig. With a small knife, cut a slit in the base of the figs. Insert an almond in the figs and pinch the slit closed.",
        "2. Arrange the figs on a baking sheet and bake 15 to 20 minutes or until lightly browned. Let cool on a wire rack.",
        "3. Make a layer of the figs in a 1-quart airtight plastic or glass container. Sprinkle with some of the fennel seeds. Top with a layer of bay leaves. Repeat the layering until all of the ingredients are used. Cover and store in a cool place (but not the refrigerator) at least 1 week before serving."
