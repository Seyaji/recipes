  "introduction": "Stuffed Sardines, Sicilian Style, also known as Sarde Beccafico, is a delightful dish from Sicily. The name translates to sardines in the style of a figpecker, a reference to a bird that revels in the sweetness of ripe figs. This traditional recipe combines the natural flavors of fresh sardines with a savory filling of bread crumbs, anchovy, pine nuts, and raisins, creating a unique and delectable meal.",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 cup plain dry bread crumbs",
    "About 1⁄4 cup olive oil",
    "4 anchovy fillets, drained and chopped",
    "2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley",
    "2 tablespoons pine nuts",
    "2 tablespoons raisins",
    "Salt and freshly ground black pepper",
    "2 pounds fresh sardines, cleaned",
    "Bay leaves",
    "Lemon wedges"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Place a rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 375°F. Oil a small baking pan.",
    "In a large skillet, toast the bread crumbs over medium heat, stirring constantly, until browned. Remove from the heat and stir in just enough oil to moisten them. Add the anchovies, parsley, pine nuts, raisins, and salt and pepper to taste. Mix well.",
    "Open the sardines like a book and place them skin side down on a flat surface. Spoon a little of the bread crumb mixture at the head end of each sardine. Roll up the sardines, enclosing the filling, and place them side by side in the pan, separating each with a bay leaf. Sprinkle any remaining crumbs over the top and drizzle with the remaining oil.",
    "Bake 20 minutes or until the rolls are just cooked through. Serve hot or at room temperature with lemon wedges."
