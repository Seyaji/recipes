      "In a small bowl, whisk together the flour, cornstarch, and salt. Stir in enough of the club soda to make a thick, smooth batter. Let stand 1 hour.",
      "Pour the oil to a 1⁄2-inch depth in a small heavy saucepan. Heat over medium heat until a small drop of the batter sizzles and swims around the pan when added to the hot oil.",
      "Line a tray with paper towels. Wipe the basil leaves with a damp paper towel. Dip the leaves in the batter. Remove the leaves a few at a time and slip them into the hot oil. Fry 2 minutes or until golden on both sides. Transfer to the paper towels to drain.",
