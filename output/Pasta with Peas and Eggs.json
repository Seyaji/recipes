  "introduction": "Pasta with Peas and Eggs, also known as Pasta con Piselli, is a delightful dish that brings together the humble, comforting flavors of peas, eggs, and pasta. With the fresh burst of frozen peas and the richness of eggs and Parmigiano-Reggiano, this recipe offers a simple yet satisfying meal that's easy to prepare with staples likely already in your kitchen.",
  "ingredients": [
    "1/4 cup olive oil",
    "1 large onion, thinly sliced",
    "1 (10-ounce) package frozen tiny peas, partially thawed",
    "Salt and freshly ground black pepper",
    "2 large eggs",
    "1/2 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano",
    "1/2 pound spaghetti or linguine, broken into 2-inch lengths"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "1. Pour the oil into a skillet large enough to hold the pasta. Add the onion and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the onion is tender and lightly browned, about 12 minutes. Stir in the peas and cook for about 5 minutes more, until the peas are tender. Season with salt and pepper.",
    "2. In a medium bowl, beat the eggs with the cheese and salt and pepper to taste.",
    "3. Bring at least 4 quarts of water to a boil in a large pot. Add 2 tablespoons of salt, then the pasta. Stir well. Cook over high heat, stirring frequently, until the pasta is tender but slightly underdone. Drain the pasta, reserving some of the cooking water.",
    "4. Stir the pasta into the skillet with the peas. Add the egg mixture and cook over low heat, stirring constantly, about 2 minutes, until the eggs are lightly set. Add a little of the cooking water if the pasta seems dry. Serve immediately."
