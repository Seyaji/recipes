The savory taste of prosciutto combined with the earthiness of mushrooms creates a harmonious dish, complemented by creamy textures and the sharpness of Parmigiano-Reggiano.",
        "ingredients": [
            "4 tablespoons unsalted butter",
            "1 package (10 ounces) mushrooms, thinly sliced",
            "1 cup frozen peas, partly thawed",
            "Salt and freshly ground black pepper",
            "4 ounces imported Italian prosciutto, in one slice about 1/4 inch thick, cut crosswise into thin strips",
            "1 pound fresh fettuccine",
            "1/2 cup heavy cream",
            "1/2 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "1. In a skillet large enough to hold all of the ingredients, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until the mushroom juices evaporate and the mushrooms begin to brown, about 10 minutes.",
            "2. Stir in the peas. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and cook 2 minutes. Stir in the prosciutto and turn off the heat. Cover to keep warm.",
            "3. Bring at least 4 quarts of water to a boil. Add 2 tablespoons of salt, then the pasta. Stir well. Cook over high heat, stirring frequently, until the pasta is al dente, tender yet still firm to the bite. Drain the pasta, reserving some of the cooking water.",
            "4. Transfer the pasta to the skillet with the vegetables and prosciutto. Turn the heat to high. Add the cream and cheese and toss again. Add some of the cooking water if the pasta seems dry. Serve immediately."
