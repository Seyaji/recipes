    "1. Place a rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 450Â°F. In a large bowl, toss the potatoes with 3 tablespoons of the oil and salt and pepper to taste. Spread the potatoes in a large shallow roasting pan. Bake the potatoes 25 to 30 minutes, or until they begin to turn brown.",

Bake about 8 to 10 minutes per inch of thickness at the widest point of the fish, or until the flesh is opaque when cut with a small sharp knife near the bone and the potatoes are tender.",
