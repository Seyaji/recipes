  "introduction": "Baked pasta dishes like Baked Ziti are cherished in southern Italy. Traditionally, these dishes were brought to local bakeries to bake after the bread for the day was done. The blend of ziti, creamy ricotta, and delicious cheeses makes it a comforting and hearty meal.",
  "ingredients": [
    "4 cups Neapolitan Ragù",
    "Salt",
    "1 pound ziti, penne, or rigatoni",
    "1 pound whole or part-skim ricotta",
    "1 cup freshly grated Pecorino Romano or Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese",
    "12 ounces fresh mozzarella, chopped or shredded"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Prepare the ragù, if necessary. Then, bring 4 quarts of water to a boil in a large pot. Add 2 tablespoons of salt, then the pasta. Stir well. Cook over high heat, stirring frequently, until almost tender. Drain the pasta.",
    "In a large bowl, toss the pasta with 2 cups of the ragù, 1 cup of the ricotta, and half the grated cheese. Slice some of the meatballs and sausages from the ragù and stir them into the pasta. (The remaining meats can be served as a second course.)",
    "Place a rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Spread half the ziti in a 13 × 9 × 2–inch baking dish. Spread the remaining ricotta on top. Sprinkle with the mozzarella. Pour on 1 cup of the sauce. Top with the remaining ziti and another cup of sauce. Sprinkle with the remaining 1/2 cup grated cheese. Cover the dish securely with foil.",
    "Bake the ziti for 45 minutes. Uncover and bake for 15 to 30 minutes more, or until the blade of a thin knife inserted into the center feels hot and the sauce is bubbling around the edges. Cool for 15 minutes on a wire rack. Serve hot."
