            "2 tablespoons olive oil",

            "1 medium onion, chopped",
            "3/4 cup dry white wine",

        "instructions": [
            "1. In a Dutch oven large enough to hold the shanks in a single layer, or another deep, heavy pot with a tight-fitting lid, heat the oil over medium heat. Pat the lamb dry and brown it well on all sides. Spoon off the excess fat. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.",
            "2. Scatter the onion around the lamb and cook until the onion is wilted, about 5 minutes. Add the wine and cook 1 minute. Stir in the tomatoes and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to low and cover the pan. Cook 1 to 1Â½ hours, turning the shanks occasionally, until the meat is very tender when pierced with a knife.",
            "3. Add the olives, garlic, capers, and parsley and cook 5 minutes more, turning the meat to coat with the sauce. Serve hot."
