    "introduction": "Bologna-Style Lasagne is a northern Italian classic distinct from its southern counterpart. This version features green-tinted spinach lasagne and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, with a rich béchamel sauce offering a creamy texture that beautifully complements the Bologna-style ragù. It's a lighter and equally delectable take on traditional lasagne.",
    "ingredients": [
      "3 to 4 cups Bologna-Style Ragù",
      "3 cups Béchamel Sauce",
      "1 pound fresh spinach lasagne",
      "Salt",
      "1 1/2 cups freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano",
      "2 tablespoons unsalted butter"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Prepare the two sauces. Bring at least 4 quarts of water to a boil. Have ready a large bowl of cold water. Add to the boiling water half the lasagne and 2 tablespoons of salt. Cook until the pasta is tender but slightly underdone. Remove the pasta with a slotted spoon and place it in the cold water. Cook the remaining lasagne strips the same way. Lay the cooled lasagne sheets out flat on lint-free towels.",
      "Butter a 13 × 10 × 2–inch pan. Set aside the 2 best-looking pasta strips for the top layer. Set aside 1/2 cup of the béchamel and 1/4 cup of the cheese. Make a layer of pasta, overlapping the pieces. Spread with thin layers of the béchamel, then the ragu, then the cheese. Repeat the layering, ending with the pasta. Spread the top layer with the reserved 1/2 cup of béchamel. Sprinkle with the reserved 1/4 cup cheese. Dot with the butter. (If you are making the lasagne ahead of time, cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.)",
      "Place a rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 375°F. Bake the lasagne 45 minutes. If the lasagne is browning too much, cover it loosely with foil. Bake 15 minutes more or until the sauce is bubbling and a knife inserted in the center comes out warm. Let stand 15 minutes before serving."
