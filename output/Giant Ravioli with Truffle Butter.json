  "introduction": "Indulge in the opulence of Giant Ravioli with Truffle Butter. This extraordinary dish features fresh egg pasta filled with ricotta encasing a sumptuous egg yolk that oozes richness when cut, blending flawlessly with a luxurious butter sauce. It's topped with either freshly shaved white or black truffles, releasing their intoxicating aroma and flavor with the heat of the pasta—a true masterpiece of Italian cuisine.",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 pound Fresh Egg Pasta, rolled out and cut into four 8 × 4–inch strips",
    "1 cup whole or part-skim ricotta",
    "2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano",
    "Pinch of ground nutmeg",
    "Salt and freshly ground black pepper",
    "4 large eggs",
    "1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted",
    "Fresh white or black truffle or a large piece of Parmigiano-Reggiano"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Prepare the pasta. Then, mix together the ricotta and grated cheese, nutmeg, and salt and pepper to taste. Scrape the filling into a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch tip or a heavy-duty plastic bag, cutting off one corner to create a 1/2-inch opening.",
    "Keeping the remaining pasta covered, lay out one strip on a countertop. Fold the strip in half crosswise, then unfold to crease the center. Leaving a 1/2-inch border all around, pipe a circle of the cheese mixture on the pasta to one side of the crease. Separate one egg, setting the white aside for another use. Carefully drop the yolk into the center of the circle. Lightly brush around the cheese with cool water. Fold the other half of the pasta over the filling. With a fork, press the edges of the pasta together to seal. Repeat with the remaining pasta and filling.",
    "Bring at least 2 quarts of water to a boil. Lower the heat until the water is simmering. Add salt to taste. Carefully place the ravioli in the water and cook just until the pasta is tender, about 3 minutes.",
    "Spoon a little of the butter into each of 4 warm serving dishes. Remove the ravioli one at a time with a slotted spoon. Place a raviolo in each dish and spoon on the remaining butter. With a swivel-blade vegetable peeler, shave thin slices of the truffle, if using, or flakes of Parmigiano over the top. Serve immediately."
  ],
  "variations": "For an alternative topping, freshly shaved flakes of Parmigiano-Reggiano can be used in place of truffle."
