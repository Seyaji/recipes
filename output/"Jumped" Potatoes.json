        "introduction": "When you order fried potatoes in an Italian restaurant, this is what you get. The potatoes become lightly crusty on the outside and soft and creamy inside. They are called \"jumped\" potatoes because they need frequent stirring or tossing in the pan.",
        "ingredients": [
            "1 1/4 pounds all-purpose potatoes, such as Yukon gold",
            "1/4 cup olive oil",
            "Salt and freshly ground black pepper"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "1. Scrub the potatoes with a brush under cold running water. Peel the potatoes. Cut them into 1-inch pieces.",
            "2. Pour the oil into a 9-inch skillet. Place the pan over medium-high heat until the oil is very hot and a piece of potato sizzles when added.",
            "3. Dry the potatoes well with paper towels. Add the potatoes to the hot oil and let cook 2 minutes. Turn the potatoes and cook 2 minutes more. Continue cooking and turning the potatoes every 2 minutes or until lightly browned on all sides, about 10 minutes in all.",
            "4. Add salt and pepper to taste. Cover the pan and cook, turning occasionally, until the potatoes are tender when pierced with a knife, about 5 minutes. Serve immediately."
        ],
        "variations": "In step 4 add 2 garlic cloves, chopped, and a tablespoon of chopped fresh rosemary or sage."
