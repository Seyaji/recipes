  "yield": "Makes 6 servings",
  "introduction": "Genuine Fontina Valle d'Aosta boasts a distinctive nutty, fruity, and earthy flavor, setting it apart from other fontinas. This rich and creamy risotto highlights the unique taste of this cheese, perfectly complemented by the sweetness of ripe tomatoes. It pairs beautifully with a floral white wine such as Arneis from the nearby Piedmont region.",
  "ingredients": [
    "5 cups Chicken Broth",
    "3 tablespoons unsalted butter",
    "1 medium onion, finely chopped",
    "1 cup peeled, seeded, and chopped tomatoes",
    "2 cups medium-grain rice, such as Arborio, Carnaroli, or Vialone Nano",
    "1/2 cup dry white wine",
    "Salt and freshly ground black pepper",
    "4 ounces Fontina Valle d'Aosta, shredded",
    "1/2 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Prepare the broth, if necessary. Bring the broth to a simmer over medium heat, then lower the heat so that it just keeps the broth hot. Melt the butter in a wide heavy saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is tender and golden, about 10 minutes.",
    "Stir in the tomatoes. Cook until most of the liquid has evaporated, about 10 minutes.",
    "Add the rice and cook, stirring with a wooden spoon, until hot, about 2 minutes. Pour the wine and 1/2 cup of the broth over the rice. Cook and stir until most of the liquid is absorbed.",
    "Continue adding broth about 1/2 cup at a time, stirring after each addition. Adjust the heat so that the liquid simmers rapidly but the rice does not stick to the pan. About halfway through the cooking, season with salt and pepper to taste.",
    "Use only as much of the broth as needed until the rice becomes tender yet firm to the bite and the risotto is creamy. When you think it may be done, taste a few grains. If not ready, test again in a minute or so. If the broth runs out before the rice is tender, use hot water. Cooking time is 18 to 20 minutes.",
    "Remove the risotto pan from the heat. Stir in the cheeses. Taste for seasoning. Serve immediately."
