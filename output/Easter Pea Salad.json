        "introduction": "This delightful Easter Pea Salad brings a touch of elegance to your spring table. Originating from the famed Romeo Salta restaurant in New York City, this salad is a homage to northern Italian cuisine, combining fresh peas with prosciutto in a lemony olive oil dressing. An addition of a hard-cooked egg yolk creates a creamy texture that pairs perfectly with the richness of prosciutto. Traditionally featuring anchovies, you can opt out and add Swiss cheese for an extra layer of flavor.",
