    "introduction": "Almond Macaroons, also known as Amaretti in southern Italy, are delightful treats made using a blend of sweet and bitter almonds. Since bitter almonds are not available in the United States due to their toxic components, commercial almond paste combined with a bit of almond extract achieves a similar flavor profile. These cookies are best baked on nonstick baking mats like Silpat to prevent sticking, though parchment paper or aluminum foil can also be used.",
    "ingredients": [
      "1 (8-ounce) can almond paste, crumbled",
      "1 cup sugar",
      "2 large egg whites, at room temperature",
      "1/4 teaspoon almond extract",
      "36 candied cherries or whole almonds"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper or aluminum foil.",
      "Crumble the almond paste into a large bowl. With an electric mixer on low speed, beat in the sugar until blended. Add the egg whites and almond extract. Increase the speed to medium and beat until very smooth, about 3 minutes.",
      "Scoop up 1 tablespoon of the batter and lightly roll it into a ball. Dampen your fingertips with cool water if necessary to prevent sticking. Place the balls about one inch apart on the prepared baking sheet. Press a cherry or almond into the top of the dough.",
      "Bake 18 to 20 minutes or until the cookies are lightly browned. Let cool briefly on the baking sheet.",
      "With a thin metal spatula, transfer the cookies to wire racks to cool completely. Store the cookies in airtight containers. (If you want to keep these cookies for more than a day or two, freeze them to maintain their soft texture. They can be eaten directly from the freezer.)"
