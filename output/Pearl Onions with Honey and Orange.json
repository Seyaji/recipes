  "introduction": "Sweet and tart pearl onions flavored with honey, orange, and vinegar are an exquisite addition to any holiday feast. They pair wonderfully with roast turkey, capon, pork, or even as an appetizer with sliced salumi. This dish can be made in advance but should be gently reheated before serving to enhance the flavors.",
  "ingredients": [
    "2 pounds pearl onions",
    "1 navel orange",
    "2 tablespoons unsalted butter",
    "1/4 cup honey",
    "1/4 cup white wine vinegar",
    "Salt and freshly ground black pepper"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the onions and cook for 3 minutes. Drain and cool them under running water. With a sharp paring knife, shave off the tip of the root ends. Do not slice off the ends too deeply or the onions will fall apart during cooking. Slip off the skins.",
    "With a swivel-blade vegetable peeler, remove the orange zest. Stack the strips of zest and cut them into thin matchsticks. Squeeze the juice from the orange. Set aside.",
    "In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the onions and cook 30 minutes or until lightly browned, shaking the pan occasionally so that they do not stick.",
    "Add the orange juice, zest, honey, vinegar, and salt and pepper to taste. Turn the heat to low and cook 10 minutes, turning the onions frequently, until the onions are tender when pierced with a knife and glazed with the sauce. Let cool slightly. Serve warm."
