  "introduction": "This delightful salad combines sweet tomatoes, slightly bitter arugula, and semi-firm ricotta salata, offering a fresh and vibrant flavor profile. Ricotta salata, a pressed salted ricotta, works wonderfully here, though feta or crumbled gorgonzola can also be used.",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 bunch arugula",
    "2 large ripe tomatoes, cored and thinly sliced",
    "2 thin slices red onion, separated into rings",
    "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil",
    "Salt and freshly ground black pepper",
    "4 ounces ricotta salata, coarsely grated"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Trim the tough stems of the arugula and discard any yellowed or bruised leaves. Wash the arugula in several changes of cool water. Dry very well. Tear the arugula into bite-size pieces.",
    "Arrange the tomatoes on a platter. Top with the arugula and onion rings. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste.",
    "Sprinkle the ricotta salata over the salad. Serve immediately."
