        "introduction": "Peppers with Almonds is a delightful dish originating from the small island of Ischia in the Bay of Naples. This colorful and flavorful creation combines the robust flavors of bell peppers and tomatoes with the briny taste of capers and anchovies, all brought together by the crunchy texture of toasted almonds. Serve it over golden-fried Italian bread for a uniquely satisfying lunch.",
        "ingredients": [
            "2 red bell peppers",
            "2 yellow bell peppers",
            "1 garlic clove, lightly crushed",
            "3 tablespoons olive oil",
            "2 medium tomatoes, peeled, seeded, and chopped",
            "1/4 cup water",
            "2 tablespoons capers",
            "4 anchovy fillets, chopped",
            "4 ounces toasted almonds, coarsely chopped"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Stand the peppers on a cutting board. Holding the stem in one hand, place the cutting edge of a large heavy chef's knife just beyond the edge of the cap. Cut straight down. Turn the pepper 90Â° and cut straight down again. Repeat, turning and cutting the remaining two sides. Discard the core, seeds, and stem, which will be in one piece. Cut away any membranes and scrape out any seeds.",
            "In a large skillet, cook the garlic with the oil over medium heat, pressing the garlic once or twice with the back of a spoon. As soon as it is lightly browned, about 4 minutes, discard the garlic.",
            "Add the peppers to the pan. Cook, stirring often, until softened, about 15 minutes.",
            "Add the tomatoes and water. Cook until the sauce is thickened, about 15 minutes more.",
            "Stir in the capers, anchovies, and almonds. Taste for salt. Cook 2 minutes more. Let cool slightly before serving."
