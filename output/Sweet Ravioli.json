  "introduction": "Jam fills these crisp dessert ravioli. Any flavor will do, as long as it has a thick consistency so that it will stay in place and not ooze out of the dough as it bakes. This was a favorite recipe perfected from traditional family cookies.",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 3/4 cup all-purpose flour",
    "1/2 cup potato or corn starch",
    "1/2 teaspoon salt",
    "1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature",
    "1/2 cup sugar",
    "1 large egg",
    "2 tablespoons rum or brandy",
    "1 teaspoon grated lemon zest",
    "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract",
    "1 cup thick sour cherry, raspberry, or apricot jam"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "In a large bowl, sift together the flour, starch, and salt.",
    "In a large bowl with an electric mixer, beat the butter with the sugar until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Beat in the egg, rum, zest, and vanilla. On low speed, stir in the dry ingredients.",
    "Divide the dough in half. Shape each half into a disk. Wrap each separately in plastic and refrigerate 1 hour up to overnight.",
    "Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Grease 2 large baking sheets.",
    "Roll out the dough to a 1/8-inch thickness. With a fluted pastry or pasta cutter, cut the dough into 2-inch squares. Arrange the squares about 1 inch apart on the prepared baking sheets. Place 1/2 teaspoon of the jam in the center of each square. (Do not use more jam, or the filling will leak out as it bakes.)",
    "Roll out the remaining dough to a 1/8-inch thickness. Cut the dough into 2-inch squares.",
    "Cover the jam with the dough squares. Press the edges all around with a fork to seal in the filling.",
    "Bake 16 to 18 minutes, or until lightly browned. Have ready 2 wire cooling racks.",
    "Transfer the baking sheets to the racks. Let the cookies cool 5 minutes on the baking sheets, then transfer them to the wire racks to cool completely. Sprinkle with confectioner's sugar. Store in an airtight container up to 1 week."
