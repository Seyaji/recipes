	"introduction": "Venetian Whole-Wheat Spaghetti in Anchovy Sauce, also known as Bigoli in Salsa, is a classic dish from Venice. Traditionally made with thick, handmade whole-wheat spaghetti, this recipe simplifies the process by using dried whole-wheat spaghetti. The robust flavors of anchovy, olive oil, and red onions combine to create a simple yet flavorful pasta dish that captures the essence of Venetian cuisine.",
	"ingredients": [
		"1/4 cup olive oil",
		"2 medium red onions, halved and thinly sliced",
		"1/2 cup dry white wine",
		"1 (3-ounce) jar anchovy fillets",
		"Salt",
		"1 pound whole-wheat spaghetti",
		"Freshly ground black pepper"
	],
	"instructions": [
		"Pour the oil into a skillet large enough to hold all of the pasta. Add the onions and cook over medium heat until the onions are golden, about 10 minutes. Add the wine and cook, stirring frequently, until the onions are soft but not browned, about 15 minutes more.",
		"Drain the anchovies, reserving the oil. Add the anchovies to the skillet and stir. Cook 10 minutes more, stirring often, until the anchovies dissolve.",
		"Bring at least 4 quarts of water to a boil in a large pot. Add 2 tablespoons of salt, then the pasta. Stir well, gently pushing the pasta down until it is completely covered with water. Cook over high heat, stirring frequently, until the pasta is al dente, tender yet still firm to the bite. Set aside some of the cooking water. Drain the pasta.",
		"Add the pasta to the pan with the sauce, and toss together 1 minute over high heat, adding a little of the water if needed. Drizzle with some of the reserved anchovy oil if desired, and top with freshly ground pepper. Serve immediately."
