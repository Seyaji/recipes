            "2 tablespoons unsalted butter",
            "8 ounces plain Italian pork sausage, casings removed and chopped fine",
            "1 cup heavy cream",
            "1/2 cup fresh or frozen tiny peas",

        "instructions": [
            "1. In a skillet large enough to hold the cooked pasta, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the sausage meat and cook, stirring frequently, just until the meat is no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Do not brown.",
            "2. Stir in the cream and peas and bring to a simmer. Cook 5 minutes or until the cream is slightly thickened. Remove from the heat.",
            "3. Bring at least 4 quarts of water to a boil. Add 2 tablespoons of salt, then the pasta. Stir well. Cook over high heat, stirring frequently, until the pasta is al dente, tender yet still firm to the bite. Drain the pasta, reserving some of the cooking water.",
            "4. Stir the pasta into the sausage mixture. Add a generous grind of black pepper and the cheese and toss thoroughly. Serve immediately."
