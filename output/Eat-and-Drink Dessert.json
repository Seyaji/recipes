        "introduction": "Fruit salads are popular all year round in Italy, but come summertime, the Florentines like to top theirs with a scoop of gelato. As the ice cream melts, it blends with the fruit juices, giving the dessert its name. A tablespoon or two of orange or apricot brandy is a nice addition. This is a great way to get nonâ€“fruit eaters to enjoy fruit.",
