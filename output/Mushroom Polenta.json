    "introduction": "Mushroom Polenta is a hearty and flavorful dish that combines the earthy taste of mushrooms with the creamy texture of polenta. The addition of pancetta gives it a rich, savory depth, but it can easily be made meatless. Leftover polenta can be sliced and fried for a delicious appetizer or side.",
    "ingredients": [
      "2 ounces finely chopped pancetta",
      "1 small onion, finely chopped",
      "2 tablespoons olive oil",
      "1 (10-ounce) package white mushrooms, trimmed and sliced",
      "2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley",
      "Salt and freshly ground black pepper",
      "4 cups cold water",
      "1 cup coarsely ground yellow cornmeal, preferably stone-ground"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "In a large skillet, combine the pancetta, onion, and oil and cook until the pancetta and onion are lightly golden, about 10 minutes. Add the mushrooms and parsley and cook until the mushroom liquid evaporates, about 10 minutes more. Season to taste with salt and pepper.",
      "In a 2-quart heavy saucepan, bring 3 cups water to a boil.",
      "In a small bowl, whisk together the cornmeal, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and remaining 1 cup cold water.",
      "Pour the cornmeal mixture into the boiling water and cook, stirring constantly, until it comes to a boil. Reduce the heat to very low, cover, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the polenta is thick and creamy, about 30 minutes. If the polenta becomes too thick, stir in more water.",
      "Stir the contents of the skillet into the polenta saucepan. Pour the mixture onto a warm platter. Serve immediately."
