    "1 medium red onion, halved and thinly sliced",

    "4 tender celery ribs, thinly sliced",
    "About 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil",

  "instructions": [
    "Place a rack or steamer basket in the bottom of a pot large enough to hold all four lobsters. Add water to come just below the rack. Bring the water to a boil. Add the lobsters and cover the pot. When the water returns to a boil and steam escapes from the pot, cook the lobsters for 10 minutes or longer, depending on their size. Transfer the lobsters to a platter and let them cool.",
    "Place the onion in a small bowl and cover with ice water. Let stand for 15 minutes. Replace the water and let it stand for another 15 minutes. Drain and pat dry.",
    "Meanwhile, remove the lobster meat from the shells. Break off the lobster tails and remove the thin shell that covers the tail meat using poultry shears. Smack the claws with the blunt side of the knife to crack them, then break them open and remove the meat with your fingers. Cut the meat into thin slices and place it in a large bowl.",
    "Stack the basil leaves and cut them crosswise into thin ribbons. Add the basil, celery, and onion to the bowl with the lobster. Drizzle with 1/4 cup of the oil and the lemon juice, and sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste. Toss well. Arrange the lobster mixture on four plates lined with lettuce leaves.",
    "Toast the bread, then rub it with a cut garlic clove. Drizzle the toast with the remaining oil and sprinkle with salt. Garnish the platter with the toast and tomato wedges. Serve immediately."
