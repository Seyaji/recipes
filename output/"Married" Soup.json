While it may be considered somewhat vintage today, its ability to provide comfort and warmth on a cold day makes it a cherished dish for many.",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 pound meaty pork ribs (country-style pork ribs)",
    "1 prosciutto bone (optional)",
    "2 medium carrots, trimmed",
    "2 celery ribs with leaves",
    "1 medium onion",
    "1 pound Italian-style pork sausage",

  "instructions": [
    "In a large pot, bring 5 quarts water to a boil. Add the pork ribs, prosciutto bone (if using), carrots, celery, and onion. Lower the heat to a simmer and cook 30 minutes over medium heat.",
    "Skim off the foam that rises to the surface. Add the sausage, prosciutto, soppressata, and crushed red pepper. Cook until the pork ribs are tender, about 2 hours.",
    "Meanwhile, wash and trim all of the vegetables. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add half the greens. Bring to a simmer and cook 10 minutes. With a slotted spoon, transfer the greens to a colander set over a large bowl. Cook the remaining greens the same way. Drain well and let cool. When cool, chop the greens into bite-size pieces.",
    "After 2 hours cooking time, remove the meats and sausage from the broth. Discard the bones and cut the meats and sausage into bite-size pieces.",
    "Let the broth cool slightly. Skim the fat from the broth. Strain the broth through a fine-mesh strainer into a large clean pot. Return the meats to the broth. Add the greens. Return to a simmer and cook 30 minutes.",
    "Serve hot, sprinkled with grated Parmigiano-Reggiano."

  "variations": [
    "Chard, chicory, kale, or cabbage can be used instead of the vegetables listed.",
