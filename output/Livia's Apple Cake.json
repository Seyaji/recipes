Made almost entirely of apples and held together by a sprinkling of amaretti cookie crumbs, this 'cake' is a perfect end to a fall or winter meal. Serve with whipped cream or rum-raisin ice cream for an added treat.",
  "ingredients": [
    "12 amaretti cookies",
    "3 pounds golden delicious, Granny Smith, or other firm apples (about 6 large)",
    "1/2 cup sugar"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    {
      "step": 1,
      "instruction": "Place the amaretti cookies in a plastic bag and crush them gently with a heavy object, such as a rolling pin. You should have about 3/4 cup of crumbs."
    },
    {
      "step": 2,
      "instruction": "Peel the apples and cut them into quarters lengthwise. Cut the quarters into 1/8-inch-thick slices."

    {
      "step": 3,
      "instruction": "Place a rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Generously butter a 9 × 3–inch round baking pan or a tube pan. Line the bottom of the pan with a circle of parchment paper. Butter the paper."
    },
    {
      "step": 4,
      "instruction": "Make a layer of apples overlapping slightly in the bottom of the pan. Sprinkle with a little of the crumbs and sugar. Alternate layers of the remaining apple slices in the pan with the remaining crumbs and sugar. The apple slices do not have to be arranged neatly. Place a sheet of foil over the top, molding it over the rim of the pan."
    },
    {
      "step": 5,
      "instruction": "Bake the apples 1 1/2 hours. Uncover and bake 30 minutes more or until the apples are tender when pierced with a knife and diminished in volume. Transfer the pan to a wire rack. Let cool at least 15 minutes. Run a knife around the edge of the pan. Holding the pan with a pot holder in one hand, place a flat serving plate over the top of the pan. Invert them both, so the apples transfer onto the plate."
