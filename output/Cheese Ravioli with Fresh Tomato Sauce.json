  "ingredients": [
    "1 pound whole or part-skim ricotta",
    "4 ounces fresh mozzarella, coarsely grated or very finely chopped",
    "1 large egg, beaten",
    "1 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano or Pecorino Romano",
    "2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley",
    "Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste",
    "4 cups Fresh Tomato Sauce",
    "1 pound Fresh Egg Pasta, rolled out and cut into 4-inch strips"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Mix together the ricotta, mozzarella, egg, 1/2 cup of the Parmigiano, the parsley, and the salt and pepper to taste. Cover and refrigerate.",
    "Prepare the sauce and pasta. Dust 2 or 3 large baking sheets with flour. Set out a small bowl filled with cool water.",
    "Lay a strip of the dough on a lightly floured surface. Fold it lengthwise in half to mark the center, then unfold it. Beginning about 1 inch from one of the short ends, place teaspoonfuls of the filling about 1 inch apart in a straight row down one side of the fold. Lightly brush around the filling with the cool water. Fold the dough over the side with filling. Press out any air bubbles and seal the edges. Use a fluted pastry wheel or a sharp knife to cut between the dough-covered mounds of filling. Separate the ravioli and press the edges firmly with the back of a fork to seal. Place the ravioli in a single layer on a baking sheet.",
    "Repeat with the remaining dough and filling. Cover with a towel and refrigerate until ready to cook, or up to 3 hours, turning the pieces several times so that they do not stick to the pan. (To store them longer, freeze the ravioli on the baking sheets until firm. Place them in a heavy-duty plastic bag and seal tightly. Store in the freezer up to one month. Do not thaw before cooking.)",
    "Just before serving, bring about 4 quarts of water to a boil in a large pot. Meanwhile, in a medium pot, heat the sauce over low heat. Pour some of the sauce into a heated serving bowl.",
    "Lower the heat under the pasta pot so that the water boils gently. Add the ravioli and cook until tender, 2 to 5 minutes depending on the thickness of the ravioli and whether or not they were frozen. Scoop the ravioli out of the pot with a slotted spoon. Drain well.",
    "Place the ravioli in the serving bowl. Pour on the remaining sauce. Sprinkle with the remaining 1/2 cup cheese and serve immediately."
