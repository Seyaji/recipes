        "yield": "Makes 4 to 6 servings",
        "introduction": "Even those who don't ordinarily enjoy anchovies will appreciate the flavor boost they give to this sauce. Their presence isn't obvious; the anchovies melt into the sauce.",
        "ingredients": [
            "2 large garlic cloves, finely chopped",
            "1/3 cup olive oil",
            "12 ounces white or brown-white mushrooms, very thinly sliced",
            "Salt and freshly ground black pepper",
            "1/2 cup dry white wine",
            "6 anchovy fillets, chopped",
            "2 large fresh tomatoes, peeled, seeded, and chopped, or 1 1/2 cups chopped canned imported Italian tomatoes, with their juice",
            "1 pound fresh fettuccine",
            "1/4 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley",
            "2 tablespoons unsalted butter"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "In a skillet large enough to hold all of the pasta, cook the garlic in the oil over medium heat for 1 minute.",
            "Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring often, until the liquid evaporates and the mushrooms begin to brown, about 10 minutes. Stir in the wine and bring to a simmer.",
            "Add the anchovies and tomatoes. Reduce the heat to low and cook 10 minutes.",
            "Bring at least 4 quarts of water to a boil. Add 2 tablespoons of salt, then the pasta. Stir well. Cook over high heat, stirring frequently, until the pasta is al dente, tender yet still firm to the bite. Drain the pasta, reserving some of the cooking water.",
            "Transfer the pasta to the skillet with the sauce and toss well with the parsley. Add the butter and toss again, adding a little of the cooking water if needed. Serve immediately."
