  "introduction": "Spaghetti, Caruso Style, is a flavorful dish inspired by the legendary Neapolitan tenor Enrico Caruso. Known for his love of cooking, Caruso crafted this pasta with rich and savory ingredients that reflect traditional Italian flavors. This dish features tender chicken livers, aromatic rosemary, and a robust tomato sauce, all tossed with perfectly cooked spaghetti and crowned with butter and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.",
  "ingredients": [
    "¼ cup olive oil",
    "¼ cup finely chopped shallots or onions",
    "8 ounces chicken livers, trimmed and cut into bite-size pieces",
    "1 teaspoon finely chopped rosemary",
    "Salt and freshly ground black pepper",
    "2 cups peeled, seeded, and chopped fresh tomatoes or canned imported Italian peeled tomatoes, drained and chopped",
    "1 pound spaghetti or linguine",
    "2 tablespoons unsalted butter",
    "½ cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Pour the oil into a skillet large enough to hold all of the pasta. Add the shallots. Cook over medium heat until tender, about 3 minutes. Add the livers, rosemary, and salt and pepper to taste. Cook 2 minutes or until the livers are no longer pink.",
    "Stir in the tomatoes and bring to a simmer. Cook 20 minutes or until slightly thickened.",
    "Bring 4 quarts of water to a boil in a large pot. Add 2 tablespoons of salt, then the pasta, gently pushing it down until the pasta is completely covered with water. Stir well. Cook over high heat, stirring frequently, until the pasta is al dente, tender yet still firm to the bite. Set aside some of the cooking water. Drain the pasta.",
    "Add the spaghetti to the sauce and toss together 1 minute over high heat. Add a little cooking water if the sauce seems too thick. Add the butter and cheese and toss again. Serve immediately."
