  "introduction": "Many Italian families cherish their pizzelle irons, which are beautifully crafted forms used to make exquisite wafer cookies known as pizzelle. Traditionally, these irons are embossed with the original owner’s initials or intricate silhouettes. Though classic irons are charming, modern electric pizzelle presses make the process quick and efficient, producing these delectable cookies with ease. Fresh pizzelle are pliable and can be shaped into cones, tubes, or cups to be filled with a variety of sweet fillings such as whipped cream or ice cream. They cool quickly to become crisp and are just as delightful when served flat.",
  "ingredients": [
    "1¾ cups unbleached all-purpose flour",
    "1 teaspoon baking powder",
    "Pinch of salt",
    "3 large eggs",
    "⅔ cup sugar",
    "1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract",
    "1 stick (½ cup) unsalted butter, melted and cooled"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "1. Preheat the pizzelle maker according to the manufacturer's directions. In a bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, and salt.",
    "2. In a large bowl, beat the eggs, sugar, and vanilla with an electric mixer on medium speed until thick and light, about 4 minutes. Beat in the butter. Stir in the dry ingredients until just blended, about 1 minute.",
    "3. Place about 1 tablespoon of the batter in the center of each pizzelle mold. (The exact amount will depend on the design of the mold.) Close the cover and bake until lightly golden. This will depend on the maker and how long the mold has been heating. Check it carefully after 30 seconds.",
    "4. When the pizzelle are golden, slide them off the molds with a wooden or plastic spatula. Let cool flat on a wire rack. Or, to make cookie cups, bend each pizzelle into the curve of a wide coffee or dessert cup. To make cannoli shells, shape them around cannoli tubes or a wooden dowel.",
    "5. When the pizzelle are cool and crisp, store them in an airtight container until ready to use. These last for several weeks."

  "variations": [
    "Anise: Substitute 1 tablespoon anise extract and 1 tablespoon anise seeds for the vanilla.",
    "Orange or Lemon: Add 1 tablespoon grated fresh orange or lemon zest to the egg mixture.",
    "Rum or Almond: Stir in 1 tablespoon rum or almond extract instead of the vanilla.",
    "Nut: Stir in ¼ cup of nuts ground to a very fine powder along with the flour."
