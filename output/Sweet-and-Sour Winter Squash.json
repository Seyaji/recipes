  "introduction": "Known as 'liver of the seven cannons' in Sicily, this recipe hails from the historic Seven Cannons district of Palermo, where residents creatively substituted squash for liver. This sweet-and-sour dish improves with time, making it perfect for preparing ahead. Typically fried, this version is baked for a lighter alternative.",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 small butternut, acorn, or other winter squash or pumpkin, cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices",
    "Olive oil",
    "1/3 cup red wine vinegar",
    "1 tablespoon sugar",
    "Salt",
    "2 garlic cloves, very finely chopped",
    "1/3 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley or mint"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "1. Rinse the squash and pat dry. Cut off the ends with a large heavy chef's knife. Peel off the skin with a vegetable peeler. Cut the squash in half and scoop out the seeds. Cut the squash into 1/4-inch thick slices. Preheat the oven to 400Â°F.",
    "2. Generously brush the squash slices on both sides with the oil. Arrange the slices on baking sheets in a single layer. Bake 20 minutes or until softened. Turn the slices and bake 15 to 20 minutes more, or until the squash is tender when pierced with a knife and lightly browned.",
    "3. Meanwhile, heat the vinegar, sugar, and salt to taste in a small saucepan. Stir until the sugar and salt are dissolved.",
    "4. On a platter or in a shallow bowl, arrange some of the squash slices in a single layer, overlapping slightly. Sprinkle with some of the garlic and parsley. Repeat the layering until all of the squash, garlic, and parsley are used. Pour the vinegar mixture over all. Cover and refrigerate at least 24 hours before serving."
