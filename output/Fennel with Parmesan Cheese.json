    "introduction": "This delicious fennel dish is made extra tender by simmering it in water before topping it with grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and baking. It pairs wonderfully with roast veal or pork, offering a delicate blend of flavors that is both comforting and elegant.",
    "ingredients": [
      "2 small fennel bulbs (about 1 pound)",
      "Salt",
      "2 tablespoons unsalted butter",
      "Freshly ground black pepper",
      "1/4 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "1. Place a rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 450°F. Generously butter a 13 × 9 × 2– inch baking dish.",
      "2. Trim off the green stalks of the fennel down to the rounded bulb. Pare away any bruises with a small knife or vegetable peeler. Slice off a thin layer from the root end. Cut the bulbs lengthwise through the core into 1/4-inch-thick slices.",
      "3. In a large pot, bring 2 quarts of water to a boil. Add the fennel and 1 teaspoon salt. Reduce the heat and simmer uncovered, until the fennel is crisp-tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain well and pat dry.",
      "4. Arrange the fennel slices in a single layer in the baking dish. Dot with the butter and sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste. Top with the cheese. Bake 10 minutes, or until the cheese is lightly browned. Serve hot or at room temperature."
