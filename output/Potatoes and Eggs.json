        "ingredients": [
            "1/4 cup olive oil",
            "4 waxy new potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/4-inch slices",

        "instructions": [
            "In a 9-inch nonstick skillet, heat the oil over medium heat. Pat the potato slices dry, and place them in the skillet. Cook, turning the pieces frequently, until the potatoes are browned and tender, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle with salt.",
            "In a medium bowl, beat the eggs with salt and pepper to taste. Pour the eggs into the pan and let them set briefly. Turn the potatoes and eggs with a spatula or spoon to allow the uncooked eggs to reach the surface of the pan. Allow the eggs to set and stir again. Repeat the stirring and cooking until the eggs are set to taste, about 2 to 3 minutes. Serve hot."
