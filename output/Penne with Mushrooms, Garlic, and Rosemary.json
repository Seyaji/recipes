        "introduction": "This delightful dish of Penne with Mushrooms, Garlic, and Rosemary can be made with any mushrooms you prefer, including exotic varieties like oyster, shiitake, or cremini. Combining different types of mushrooms can add depth to the flavor. When using wild mushrooms, such as morels, ensure they are cleaned thoroughly to avoid any grittiness.",
        "ingredients": [
            "1/4 cup olive oil",
            "1 pound mushrooms, thinly sliced",
            "2 large garlic cloves, finely chopped",
            "2 teaspoons very finely chopped fresh rosemary",
            "Salt and freshly ground black pepper",
            "1 pound penne or farfalle",
            "2 tablespoons unsalted butter",
            "2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "1. In a skillet large enough to hold the pasta, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the mushrooms, garlic, and rosemary. Cook, stirring frequently, until the mushrooms begin to release their liquid, about 10 minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste. Cook, stirring often, until the mushrooms are lightly browned, about 5 minutes more.",
            "2. Bring at least 4 quarts of water to a boil in a large pot. Add 2 tablespoons of salt, then the pasta. Stir well. Cook over high heat, stirring frequently, until the pasta is al dente, tender yet firm to the bite. Set aside some of the cooking water.",
            "3. Drain the pasta. Toss the pasta in the skillet with the mushrooms, butter, and parsley. Add a little of the cooking water if the pasta seems dry. Serve immediately."
