    "introduction": "Fried cardoons are a delightful culinary experience, combining the subtle flavor of cardoons with a crispy and savory exterior. Perfect as an antipasto dish or a side for lamb or fish, these crunchy delights are sure to impress.",
    "ingredients": [
      "1 lemon, cut in half",
      "2 pounds cardoons",
      "3 large eggs",
      "2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano",
      "Salt and freshly ground black pepper",
      "2 cups plain bread crumbs",
      "Vegetable oil for frying",
      "Lemon wedges"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Squeeze the lemon into a large bowl of cold water. Trim the ends of the cardoons and separate the stalk into ribs. With a paring knife, peel each rib to remove the long tough strings and any leaves. Cut each rib into 3-inch lengths. Place the pieces in the lemon water.",
      "Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil. Drain the cardoons and add them to the pan. Boil until tender when pierced with a knife, about 20 to 30 minutes. Drain well and cool under running water. Pat the pieces dry.",
      "Line a tray with paper towels. In a shallow bowl, beat the eggs with the cheese, salt, and pepper to taste. Spread the bread crumbs on a sheet of wax paper. Dip the cardoons in the egg, then roll them in the bread crumbs.",
      "In a large deep skillet, heat about 1/2 inch of oil over medium heat until a small drop of the egg sizzles and cooks rapidly when dropped into the pan. Add just enough of the cardoons to fit in one layer without crowding. Cook, turning the pieces with tongs, until browned and crisp on all sides, about 3 to 4 minutes. Drain on the paper towels. Keep them warm in a low oven while frying the remainder. Serve hot with lemon wedges."
