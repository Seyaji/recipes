        "introduction": "Neapolitan-Style Eggplant Sticks with Tomatoes is a delightful appetizer inspired by the small beginnings of meals at Restaurant Dante and Beatrice in Naples. This dish makes use of milder Japanese eggplants cooked to a tender perfection in a robust tomato and basil sauce.",
        "ingredients": [
            "6 small Japanese eggplants (about 1 1/2 pounds)",
            "Vegetable oil for frying",
            "Salt",
            "2 garlic cloves, peeled and lightly smashed",
            "Pinch of crushed red pepper",
            "3 tablespoons olive oil",
            "4 plum tomatoes, peeled, seeded, and chopped",
            "1/4 cup basil leaves, stacked and cut into thin strips"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "1. Trim the tops and bottoms of the eggplants and cut them into 6 wedges lengthwise. Cut crosswise into 3 pieces. Pat the pieces dry with paper towels.",
            "2. Line a tray with paper towels. Pour about 1/2 inch of oil into a medium skillet. Heat over medium heat until a small piece of eggplant sizzles when added to the pan. Carefully add just as many eggplants as will fit comfortably in the pan in a single layer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned around the edges, about 5 minutes. Remove the eggplants with a slotted spoon or skimmer and drain on the paper towels. Repeat with the remaining eggplant. Sprinkle with salt.",
            "3. In a large skillet, cook the garlic with the red pepper in the olive oil until the garlic is deep golden, about 4 minutes. Remove and discard the garlic. Add the tomatoes and cook 5 minutes or until thickened.",
            "4. Stir in the eggplants and basil and cook 2 minutes more. Season with salt to taste. Serve hot or at room temperature."
