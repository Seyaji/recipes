      "introduction": "Oranges Gratinéed with Zabaglione is a delightful combination of citrusy oranges topped with a rich and creamy Italian custard known as zabaglione. The dish is briefly broiled to achieve a beautifully browned surface, imparting a layer of complexity to the sweet and tangy flavors. This versatile dessert can be made with other soft fruits like bananas, kiwis, or berries.",
      "ingredients": [
        "6 navel oranges, peeled and thinly sliced",
        "1 large egg",
        "2 large egg yolks",
        "1/3 cup sugar",
        "1/3 cup dry or sweet Marsala"
      ],
      "instructions": [
        "Preheat the broiler. Arrange the orange slices in a flameproof baking dish, overlapping slightly.",
        "Prepare the zabaglione: Fill a small saucepan or the bottom of a double boiler with 2 inches of water. Bring it to a simmer over low heat. In a bowl larger than the rim of the pan or the top of the double boiler, combine the egg, yolks, sugar, and Marsala. Beat with a hand-held electric beater until foamy. Place over the pan of simmering water. Beat until the mixture is pale-colored and holds a soft shape when the beaters are lifted, about 5 minutes.",
        "Spread the zabaglione over the oranges. Put the dish under the broiler 1 to 2 minutes or until the zabaglione is browned in spots. Serve immediately."
