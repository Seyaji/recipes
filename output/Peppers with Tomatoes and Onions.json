  "ingredients": [
    "4 red or yellow bell peppers (or a mix)",

  ],
  "instructions": [
    "1. Stand the peppers on a cutting board. Holding the stem in one hand, place the cutting edge of a large heavy chef's knife just beyond the edge of the cap. Cut straight down. Turn the pepper 90Â° and cut straight down again. Repeat, turning and cutting the remaining two sides. Discard the core, seeds, and stem, which will be in one piece. Cut away any membranes and scrape out any seeds. Cut the peppers into 1/4-inch strips.",
    "2. In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the onions in the olive oil until tender and golden, about 10 minutes. Add the pepper strips and cook 10 minutes more.",
    "3. Stir in the tomatoes, garlic, and salt to taste. Cover and cook 20 minutes or until the peppers are tender when pierced with a knife. If there is a lot of liquid remaining, uncover and cook until the sauce is thickened and reduced. Serve hot or at room temperature."
