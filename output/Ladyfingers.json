        "introduction": "These crisp, light cookies, known as Savoiardi, are an Italian classic named for the royal House of Savoy. Perfect with tea, ice cream, or fruit, they also serve as a key ingredient in desserts like tiramisù. Potato starch contributes to their delicate texture, although cornstarch can be used as a substitute.",
        "ingredients": [
            "4 large eggs, at room temperature",
            "2/3 cup sugar",
            "2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract",
            "1/2 cup all-purpose flour",
            "1/4 cup potato starch",
            "Pinch of salt"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Preheat the oven to 400°F. Grease and flour 3 large baking sheets.",
            "Separate the eggs. In a large bowl, using an electric mixer at medium speed, beat the egg yolks with 1/3 cup of the sugar and the vanilla until thick and pale yellow, about 7 minutes.",
            "In a large clean bowl with clean beaters, beat the egg whites with a pinch of salt on low speed until foamy. Increase the speed to high and gradually add the remaining 1/3 cup sugar. Beat until the egg whites hold soft peaks when the beaters are lifted, about 5 minutes.",
            "With a rubber spatula, fold about 1/3 of the egg whites into the egg yolks to lighten them. Gradually fold in the remaining whites.",
            "Place the flour and starch in a small fine-mesh strainer. Shake the strainer over the eggs and fold in the dry ingredients gently but thoroughly.",
            "Scoop the batter into a large pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch tip or into a heavy-duty plastic bag with a corner cut off. (Do not fill the bag more than halfway.) Pipe the batter onto the baking sheets, forming 3 × 1-inch logs about 1 inch apart.",
            "Have several wire cooling racks ready. Bake the cookies 10 to 12 minutes, or until they are golden brown and feel firm when touched lightly in the center.",
            "Transfer the baking sheets to the cooling racks. Cool the cookies 2 minutes on the baking sheets, then transfer them to the racks to cool completely. Store in an airtight container at room temperature up to 2 weeks."
