    "introduction": "Sandwiching a tasty filling between two boneless fish fillets is a delightful way to enjoy stuffed fish minus the hassle of bones. This dish, featuring sea bass and a savory mushroom mixture, can also be adapted using salmon, grouper, or bluefish. Opt for fillets of similar size and shape to ensure even cooking.",
    "ingredients": [
      "4 tablespoons olive oil",
      "3 green onions, chopped",
      "1 garlic clove, chopped",
      "8 ounces white mushrooms, trimmed and chopped",
      "2 anchovy fillets, chopped",
      "Salt and freshly ground black pepper",
      "1/2 cup dry white wine",
      "2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley",
      "2 tablespoons plain bread crumbs",
      "2 sea bass, grouper, or bluefish fillets of similar shape (about 3/4 pounds each), skin removed"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "1. Place a rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Oil a baking pan large enough to hold the stacked fillets.",
      "2. Pour 3 tablespoons of the oil into a large skillet. Add the green onions and garlic and cook over medium heat until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the mushrooms, anchovies, and salt and pepper to taste. Cook 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the wine and simmer 15 minutes or until the liquid is evaporated. Remove from the heat and stir in the parsley and bread crumbs.",
      "3. Lay one fillet skinned-side down in the pan.",
      "4. Spread about two-thirds of the mushroom mixture over the fillet in the pan. Top with the second fillet skinned-side down and spread the remaining mushroom mixture over the top. Drizzle with the remaining tablespoon of oil.",
      "5. Bake 15 to 20 minutes, depending on the thickness, or until the fish is just barely opaque when cut in the thickest part. Serve hot."
