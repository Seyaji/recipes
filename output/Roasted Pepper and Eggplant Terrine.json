        "ingredients": [
            "4 large red bell peppers, roasted and peeled",
            "2 large eggplants (about 1½ pounds each)",
            "Salt",
            "Olive oil",
            "½ cup torn fresh basil leaves",
            "4 large garlic cloves, peeled, seeded, and finely chopped",
            "¼ cup red wine vinegar",
            "Freshly ground black pepper"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Prepare the peppers, if necessary. Trim the eggplants and cut them lengthwise into ¼-inch-thick slices. Layer the slices in a colander, sprinkling each layer with salt. Let stand at least 30 minutes.",
            "Preheat the oven to 450°F. Brush two large jelly roll pans with oil.",
            "Rinse the eggplant slices in cool water and pat dry with paper towels. Arrange the eggplant in the pans in a single layer. Brush with oil. Bake the eggplant about 10 minutes, until lightly browned on top. Turn the pieces with tongs and bake about 10 minutes more or until tender and lightly browned.",
            "Drain the peppers and cut them into 1-inch strips.",
            "Line an 8 × 4 × 3–inch loaf pan with plastic wrap. Place a layer of eggplant slices in the bottom of the pan, overlapping them slightly. Make a layer of the roasted peppers over the eggplant. Sprinkle with some of the basil, garlic, vinegar, oil, and salt and pepper to taste. Continue layering, pressing each layer down firmly, until all of the ingredients are used. Cover with plastic wrap and weight the contents with a second loaf pan filled with heavy cans. Refrigerate for at least 24 hours or up to 3 days.",
            "To serve, uncover the terrine and invert it onto a serving plate. Carefully remove the plastic wrap. Cut the terrine into thick slices. Serve cold or at room temperature."
