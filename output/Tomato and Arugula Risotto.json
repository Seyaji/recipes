  "ingredients": [
    "5 cups Chicken Broth",
    "1 large bunch arugula, trimmed and rinsed",
    "3 tablespoons olive oil",
    "1 small onion, finely chopped",
    "2 pounds ripe plum tomatoes, peeled, seeded, and chopped",
    "2 cups medium-grain rice, such as Arborio, Carnaroli, or Vialone Nano",
    "Salt and freshly ground black pepper",
    "1/2 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano",
    "2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil",
    "1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Prepare the broth, if necessary. Bring the broth to a simmer over medium heat, then lower the heat so that it just keeps the broth hot. Tear the arugula leaves into bite size pieces. You should have about 2 cups.",
    "Pour the oil into a wide heavy saucepan. Add the onion and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon, until the onion is very tender and golden, about 10 minutes.",
    "Stir in the tomatoes. Cook, stirring occasionally, until most of the juice has evaporated, about 10 minutes.",
    "Add the rice and cook, stirring with a wooden spoon until hot, about 2 minutes. Pour 1/2 cup of the broth over the rice. Cook and stir until most of the liquid is absorbed.",
    "Continue adding broth about 1/2 cup at a time, stirring after each addition. Adjust the heat so that the liquid simmers rapidly but the rice does not stick to the pan. Halfway through the cooking, season with salt and pepper. Use only as much of the broth as needed until the rice becomes tender yet firm to the bite and the risotto is creamy. When you think it may be done, taste a few grains. If not ready, test again in a minute or so. If the broth runs out before the rice is tender, use hot water. Cooking time will be 18 to 20 minutes.",
    "Remove the risotto pan from the heat. Stir in the cheese, basil, and a tablespoon of extra-virgin olive oil. Taste for seasoning. Stir in the arugula and serve immediately."
