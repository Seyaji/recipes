For an indulgent twist, try it affogato style with a splash of grappa or limoncello.",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 cup water",
    "2⁄3 cup sugar",
    "2½ cups ice cubes",
    "1 teaspoon grated lemon zest",
    "½ cup freshly squeezed lemon juice"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "1. In a small saucepan, combine the water and sugar. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until the sugar is dissolved, about 3 minutes. Let cool slightly. Place the ice cubes in a large bowl and pour the syrup over the ice cubes. Stir until the ice is melted. Refrigerate until chilled, about 1 hour.",
    "2. Chill a 13 × 9 × 2–inch metal pan in the freezer. In a medium bowl, combine the sugar syrup, lemon zest, and lemon juice. Remove the pan from the freezer, then pour the mixture into it. Freeze 30 minutes or until a 1-inch border of ice crystals forms around the edges.",
    "3. Stir the ice crystals into the center of the mixture. Return the pan to the freezer and continue freezing, stirring every 30 minutes, until all of the liquid is frozen, about 2 to 2½ hours. Serve immediately, or scrape the mixture into a plastic container, cover, and store in the freezer up to 24 hours.",
    "4. Remove from the freezer to soften about 15 minutes before serving, if necessary."
