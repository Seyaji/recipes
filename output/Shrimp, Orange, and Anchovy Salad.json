    "yield": "Makes 4 servings",
    "introduction": "This Shrimp, Orange, and Anchovy Salad is a delightful blend of fresh citrus, seafood, and savory anchovies, inspired by the zesty dishes of a Venetian trattoria. The incorporation of Dijon mustard provides a tangy punch, while the fresh herbs and garlic elevate the vibrant flavors of the shrimp and oranges.",
    "ingredients": [
      "1 small red onion, thinly sliced",
      "2 teaspoons Dijon mustard",
      "1 garlic clove, lightly crushed",
      "4 teaspoons fresh lemon juice",
      "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil",
      "1 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary",
      "Salt and freshly ground black pepper",
      "24 large shrimp, shelled and deveined",
      "4 navel oranges, peeled, white pith removed and sliced",
      "1 (2-ounce) can anchovy fillets, drained"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Place the onion in a medium bowl with very cold water to cover. Let stand 10 minutes. Drain the onion and cover it again with very cold water and let stand 10 minutes more. (This will make the onion flavor less sharp.) Pat the onion dry.",
      "In a large bowl, whisk together the mustard, garlic, lemon juice, oil, and rosemary with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.",
      "Bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil over medium heat. Add the shrimp and salt to taste. Cook until the shrimp turn pink and are just cooked through, about 2 minutes, depending on their size. Drain and cool under running water.",
      "Add the shrimp to the bowl with the dressing and toss well. Arrange the watercress on serving plates. Top with the orange slices. Spoon the shrimp and dressing over the oranges. Scatter the onion slices on top. Serve immediately."
