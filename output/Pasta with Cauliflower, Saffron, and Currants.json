    "ingredients": [
        "1 teaspoon saffron threads",
        "2/3 cup currants or dark raisins",
        "Salt",
        "1 large cauliflower (about 2 pounds), trimmed and cut into florets",
        "1/3 cup olive oil",
        "1 medium onion, finely chopped",
        "6 anchovy fillets, drained and chopped",
        "Freshly ground black pepper",
        "1/3 cup pine nuts, lightly toasted",
        "1 pound penne or shells",
        "1/4 cup toasted plain bread crumbs"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "In a small bowl, sprinkle the saffron threads with 2 tablespoons of hot water. Place the currants in another bowl with hot water to cover. Let both stand about 10 minutes.",
        "Bring at least 4 quarts of water to a boil in a large pot. Add 2 tablespoons of salt and the cauliflower. Cook, stirring frequently, until the cauliflower is very tender when pierced with a knife, about 10 minutes. Remove the cauliflower with a slotted spoon, reserving the water to cook the pasta.",
        "Pour the oil into a skillet large enough to hold the cooked pasta. Add the onion and cook over medium heat 10 minutes. Add the anchovies and cook 2 minutes more, stirring frequently until they dissolve. Stir in the saffron and soaking liquid. Drain the currants and add them to the skillet.",
        "Stir in the cooked cauliflower. Scoop up some of the cooking water and add it to the skillet with the cauliflower. Cook 10 minutes, breaking up the cauliflower with the back of a spoon, until it is in small pieces. Add salt and pepper to taste. Stir in the pine nuts.",
        "While the cauliflower cooks, bring the cooking water back to a boil. Add the pasta and stir well. Cook over high heat, stirring frequently, until the pasta is al dente, tender yet still firm to the bite. Set aside some of the cooking water. Drain the pasta, then add it to the skillet with the cauliflower mixture. Stir well, adding some of the cooking water if the pasta seems dry.",
        "Serve the pasta sprinkled with the toasted bread crumbs."
