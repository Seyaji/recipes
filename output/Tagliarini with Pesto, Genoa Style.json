    "titleAlternative": "Tagliarini al Pesto",
    "yield": "Makes 4 to 6 servings",
    "introduction": "In Liguria during the spring, thin strands of fresh pasta are elegantly combined with a fragrant pesto sauce, tender green beans, and sliced new potatoes. This harmonious blend not only captures the rich flavors of the pesto but also provides a delightful texture and lightness to the dish.",
    "ingredients": [
        "1 cup packed fresh basil leaves",
        "1/2 cup packed fresh flat-leaf parsley",
        "1/4 cup pine nuts",
        "1 garlic clove",
        "Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste",
        "1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil",
        "1 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano or Pecorino Romano",
        "4 medium waxy potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced",
        "8 ounces thin green beans, cut into 1-inch lengths",
        "1 pound fresh tagliarini or fettuccine",
        "2 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "In a food processor or blender, combine the basil, parsley, pine nuts, garlic, and a pinch of salt. Chop fine. With the machine running, add the oil in a steady stream and process until smooth. Stir in the cheese.",
        "Bring at least 4 quarts of water to a boil. Add the potatoes and green beans. Cook just until tender, about 8 minutes. Scoop out the vegetables with a slotted spoon. Place them in a warmed serving bowl. Cover and keep warm.",
        "Add the pasta to the boiling water and stir well. Cook over high heat, stirring frequently, until the pasta is al dente, tender yet still firm to the bite. Drain the pasta, reserving some of the cooking water.",
        "Add the pasta, pesto, and butter to the serving bowl with the vegetables. Toss very well, adding a little of the cooking water if the pasta seems dry. Serve immediately."
