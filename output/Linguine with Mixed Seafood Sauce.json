    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Cut the calamari bodies into 1/2-inch rings and the base of the tentacles in half crosswise. Cut the shrimp into 1/2-inch pieces. Pat the seafood dry.",
      "In a skillet large enough to hold all of the ingredients, heat 4 tablespoons of the oil over medium-high heat. Add the calamari and salt to taste. Cook, stirring often, until the calamari are just opaque, about 2 minutes. Scoop the calamari out with a slotted spoon and transfer to a plate. Add the shrimp and salt to taste to the pan. Cook, stirring, until the shrimp are just pink, about 1 minute. Transfer the shrimp to the plate with the calamari.",
      "Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of the oil, garlic, parsley, and red pepper to the pan. Cook, stirring, until the garlic is golden, about 2 minutes. Add the tomatoes and clam juice. Cook for 5 minutes or until the tomatoes are tender. Stir in the calamari, shrimp, and clams.",
      "Bring at least 4 quarts of water to a boil in a large pot. Add 2 tablespoons of salt, then the pasta, gently pushing it down until the pasta is completely covered with water. Stir well. Cook over high heat, stirring frequently, until the pasta is al dente, tender yet still firm to the bite. Drain the pasta, reserving some of the cooking water.",
      "Add the pasta to the pan with the seafood. Cook over high heat, tossing the pasta with the sauce, for 30 seconds. Add a little cooking water if needed. Drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil and toss again. Serve hot."
