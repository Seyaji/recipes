  "titleAlternative": "Fave alla Romana",
  "yield": "Makes 4 servings",
  "introduction": "Fresh fava beans in their pods are a quintessential spring vegetable in central and southern Italy. Enjoyed for their tender texture and unique flavor, they are often eaten raw with young pecorino cheese or stewed with other seasonal vegetables like peas and artichokes. For the best experience, try them both peeled and unpeeled to see which method you prefer. Although fresh favas offer a different taste from their dried counterparts, frozen fava beans or lima beans can make a suitable substitute when fresh ones are not available.",
