      "Bring 4 quarts of water to a boil in a large pot. Add 2 tablespoons of salt, then the pasta, gently pushing it down until the pasta is completely covered with water. Cook over high heat, stirring frequently, until al dente, tender yet still firm to the bite. Set aside some of the cooking water. Drain the pasta.",
      "Add the pasta to the skillet with the sauce. Toss the pasta in the sauce over high heat until it is well coated. Add a little cooking water if the sauce seems too thick. Stir in the cheese and toss again. Serve immediately."
