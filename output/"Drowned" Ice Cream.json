        "introduction": "Any flavor of ice cream can be 'drowned' in hot espresso, but walnut caramel and cream are two delightful choices. When the hot espresso meets the ice cream, it creates a luxurious, creamy sauce. Liqueur is optional, but can add a delicious depth of flavor.",

            "4 scoops Walnut Caramel or 'Cream' Ice Cream",
            "1/2 cup hot brewed espresso",

        "instructions": [
            "Prepare the ice cream, if necessary. Scoop the ice cream into two serving bowls.",
            "If using the liqueur, in a small bowl, mix together the espresso and liqueur, then pour the mixture over the ice cream. Serve immediately."
