  "instructions": [
    "Put the mushrooms in the water and let soak 30 minutes. Lift the mushrooms from the water, reserving the liquid. Rinse the mushrooms under cold running water to remove any grit, paying special attention to the ends of the stems where soil collects. Chop the mushrooms coarsely. Strain the mushroom liquid into a bowl. Set aside.",
    "With a large knife, trim off the top 1 inch of the artichokes. Rinse them well under cold water. Bend back and snap off the small leaves around the base. With scissors, trim the pointed tops off the remaining leaves. Peel off the tough outer skin of the stems and around the base. Cut the artichokes in half. Use a small knife to scrape out the fuzzy leaves in the center. Thinly slice the artichokes.",
    "Pour the oil into a skillet large enough to hold the cooked pasta. Add the onion, mushrooms, parsley, and garlic and cook over medium heat for 10 minutes. Stir in the artichokes, tomatoes, and salt and pepper to taste. Cook 10 minutes. Add the mushroom liquid and cook 10 minutes more or until the artichokes are tender when tested with a knife.",
    "Bring 4 quarts of water to a boil in a large pot. Add 2 tablespoons of salt, then the pasta. Stir well. Cook over high heat, stirring frequently, until the pasta is al dente, tender yet still firm to the bite. Set aside some of the cooking water. Drain the pasta.",
    "Toss the pasta with the sauce and a little of the cooking water if needed. Drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil and serve immediately."
