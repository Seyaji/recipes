    "introduction": "Spaghetti with Garlic and Olives is a flavorful and simple dish that combines the richness of olive oil with the bold taste of garlic and the briny punch of olives. This quick pasta sauce is perfect for busy weeknights. While you can use olives that you pit and chop yourself, using prepared olive paste makes this recipe even more convenient. It's an easy go-to meal that doesn't require grated cheese due to the naturally salty ingredients.",
    "ingredients": [
      "1/4 cup olive oil",
      "3 garlic cloves, sliced thin",
      "Pinch of crushed red pepper",
      "1/4 cup green olive paste, or to taste, or 1 cup chopped pitted green olives",
      "2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley",
      "Salt",
      "1 pound spaghetti or linguine"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Pour the oil into a skillet large enough to hold the cooked pasta. Add the garlic and crushed red pepper. Cook over medium heat until the garlic is a deep gold, about 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in the olive paste or the olives and parsley and remove the skillet from the heat.",
      "Bring 4 quarts of water to boiling in a large pot. Add 2 tablespoons of salt, then the pasta, gently pushing it down until the pasta is completely covered with water. Cook over high heat, stirring frequently, until the pasta is al dente, tender yet still firm to the bite. Set aside some of the cooking water. Drain the pasta and add it to the skillet with the sauce.",
      "Cook over medium heat, tossing until the pasta is well coated with the sauce. Add a little of the hot cooking water if the pasta seems dry. Serve immediately."
