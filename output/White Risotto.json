  "introduction": "This plain white risotto is as basic and satisfying as vanilla ice cream. Serve it as is as a first course or as a side dish with braised meats. If you happen to have a fresh truffle, try shaving it over the finished risotto for a luxurious touch. In that case, you should eliminate the cheese.",
  "ingredients": [
    "4 cups Meat Broth or Chicken Broth",
    "4 tablespoons unsalted butter",
    "1 tablespoon olive oil",
    "1/4 cup minced shallots or onion",
    "1 1/2 cups medium-grain rice, such as Arborio, Carnaroli, or Vialone Nano",
    "1/2 cup dry white wine or sparkling wine",
    "Salt and freshly ground black pepper",
    "1/2 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "1. Prepare the broth, if necessary. Bring the broth to a simmer over medium heat, then lower the heat so that it is just keeping the broth hot. In a wide heavy saucepan, melt 3 tablespoons of the butter with the oil over medium heat. Add the shallots and cook until softened but not browned, about 5 minutes.",
    "2. Add the rice and stir with a wooden spoon until hot, about 2 minutes. Add the wine and cook, stirring, until most of the liquid evaporates.",
    "3. Pour 1/2 cup of the broth over the rice. Cook, stirring, until most of the liquid is absorbed. Continue adding broth about 1/2 cup at a time, stirring after each addition. Adjust the heat so that the liquid simmers rapidly but the rice does not stick to the pan. About halfway through the cooking time, add salt and pepper to taste.",
    "4. Use only as much of the broth as needed until the rice becomes tender yet firm to the bite and the risotto is creamy. When you think it may be done, taste a few grains. If not ready, test again in a minute or so. If the broth runs out before the rice is tender, use hot water. Cooking time will be 18 to 20 minutes.",
    "5. Remove the risotto pan from the heat. Stir in the remaining tablespoon of butter and cheese until melted and creamy. Serve immediately."
