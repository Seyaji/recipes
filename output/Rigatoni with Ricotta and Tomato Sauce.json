    "introduction": "Rigatoni with Ricotta and Tomato Sauce is a classic southern Italian dish that brings together the creamy richness of ricotta cheese and the robust flavors of tomato sauce. This comforting meal can be served either by mixing the sauce and cheese into the pasta or by passing the ricotta separately for a personalized touch. It's a simple yet satisfying way to enjoy pasta.",
    "ingredients": [
      "2 1/2 cups tomato sauce, such as Marinara Sauce or Tuscan Tomato Sauce",
      "1 pound rigatoni, shells, or cavatelli",
      "Salt",
      "1 cup whole or part-skim ricotta, at room temperature",
      "Freshly grated Pecorino Romano or Parmigiano-Reggiano, to taste"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Prepare the sauce, if necessary. Bring at least 4 quarts of water to a boil in a large pot. Add 2 tablespoons of salt, then the pasta. Stir well. Cook over high heat, stirring frequently, until the pasta is al dente, tender yet still firm to the bite.",
      "While the pasta is cooking, bring the sauce to a simmer, if needed.",
      "Spoon a little of the hot sauce into a heated serving bowl. Drain the pasta and place it in the bowl. Toss immediately, adding more sauce to taste. Add the ricotta and stir well. Pass the grated cheese separately. Serve immediately."
