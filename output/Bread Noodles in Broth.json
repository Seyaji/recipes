  "introduction": "Passatelli are traditional noodle-like strands from Emilia-Romagna, crafted from dry bread crumbs and grated cheese bound with eggs. These noodles are effortlessly created by pressing the dough through a device similar to a potato ricer into broth. Once a Sunday staple, Passatelli in broth is savory and comforting.",
  "ingredients": [
    "8 cups homemade Meat Broth or Chicken Broth or a mix of half store-bought broth and half water",
    "3 large eggs",
    "1 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, plus more for serving",
    "2 tablespoons very finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley",
    "1/4 teaspoon grated nutmeg",
    "About 3/4 cup plain dry bread crumbs"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "1. Prepare the broth, if necessary. In a large bowl, beat the eggs until blended. Stir in the cheese, parsley, and nutmeg until smooth. Add enough bread crumbs to form a smooth, thick paste.",
    "2. If not freshly made, bring the broth to a simmer in a large pot. Taste the broth and adjust the seasoning, if necessary.",
    "3. Place a food mill fitted with the large-hole blade, a potato ricer, or a colander with large holes over the pot. Push the cheese mixture through the food mill or colander into the simmering broth. Cook over low heat for 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and let stand 2 minutes before serving. Serve hot with additional cheese."
