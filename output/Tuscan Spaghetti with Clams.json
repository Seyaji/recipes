  "ingredients": [
    "3 pounds small hard-shell clams or New Zealand cockles, well scrubbed",
    "Salt",
    "1/3 cup olive oil",
    "1 small onion, finely chopped",
    "2 garlic cloves, finely chopped",
    "Pinch of crushed red pepper",
    "1 1/2 cups peeled, seeded, and chopped fresh tomatoes or drained and chopped canned imported Italian tomatoes",
    "1/2 cup dry white wine",

    "1 pound spaghetti or linguine"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "1. Place the clams in a large pot with 1/4 cup water over medium-high heat. Cover the pot and cook until the liquid is boiling and the clams begin to open. Remove the opened clams with a slotted spoon and transfer to a bowl. Continue cooking the unopened clams. Discard any that do not open.",
    "2. Working over a small bowl to catch the juices, scrape the clams from the shells, placing them in another bowl. Pour all of the liquid from the pot into the bowl with the juices. If the clams are sandy, rinse them one at a time in the clam juices. Pass the liquid through a fine-mesh strainer lined with cheesecloth.",
    "3. Pour the oil into a large saucepan. Add the onion and cook, stirring frequently, over medium heat until the onion is golden, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic and crushed red pepper and cook 2 minutes more.",
    "4. Stir in the tomatoes, wine, and strained clam juice. Simmer 20 minutes or until the sauce is reduced and thickened.",
    "5. Bring at least 4 quarts of water to a boil in a large pot. Add 2 tablespoons of salt, then the pasta, gently pushing it down until the pasta is completely covered with water. Stir well. Cook over high heat, stirring frequently, until the pasta is al dente, tender yet still firm to the bite. Set aside some of the cooking water. Drain the pasta.",
    "6. Stir the clams and parsley into the sauce. Add some of the water if needed. In a heated serving bowl, toss the sauce and pasta together. Serve immediately."
