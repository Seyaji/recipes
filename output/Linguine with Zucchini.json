  "introduction": "For a delightful summer pasta dish, Linguine with Zucchini showcases the best of garden-fresh produce. Smaller zucchini varieties are ideal; they offer tender texture and rich flavor, unlike their larger, blander counterparts. Enhanced with sharp Pecorino Romano, this recipe combines simplicity and taste for a memorable Italian meal.",
  "ingredients": [
    "6 small green or yellow zucchini (about 2 pounds)",
    "1/3 cup olive oil",
    "3 garlic cloves, finely chopped",
    "Salt and freshly ground black pepper",
    "1/4 cup chopped fresh basil",
    "2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley",
    "1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme",
    "1 pound linguine",
    "1/2 cup freshly grated Pecorino Romano"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "1. Scrub the zucchini under cold water. Trim the ends. Cut into quarters lengthwise, then into slices.",
    "2. In a skillet large enough to hold the pasta, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the zucchini and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned and tender, about 10 minutes. Push the zucchini to the side of the pan and add the garlic, salt, and pepper. Cook for 2 minutes. Add the herbs, stir the zucchini back into the seasonings, and then remove from the heat.",
    "3. While the zucchini is cooking, bring 4 quarts of water to a boil in a large pot. Add 2 tablespoons of salt, then the pasta. Stir well. Cook over high heat, stirring frequently, until the pasta is al dente, tender yet firm to the bite. Set aside some of the cooking water.",
    "4. Drain the pasta. Place the pasta in the skillet with the zucchini. Toss well, adding some of the cooking water if needed. Add the cheese and toss again. Serve immediately."
