    "titleAlternative": "Cavatelli con Sugo di Calamari",
    "yield": "Makes 6 servings",
    "introduction": "The slightly chewy texture of calamari complements the chewiness of the cavatelli in this contemporary Sicilian recipe. The sauce gets a smooth, velvety texture from a mixture of flour and olive oil and a lovely yellow color from saffron.",
    "ingredients": [
      "1 teaspoon saffron threads",
      "2 tablespoons warm water",
      "1 medium onion, finely chopped",
      "2 garlic cloves, very finely chopped",
      "5 tablespoons olive oil",
      "1 pound cleaned calamari (squid), cut into 1/2-inch rings",
      "1/2 cup dry white wine",
      "Salt and freshly ground black pepper",
      "1 tablespoon flour",
      "1 pound fresh or frozen cavatelli",
      "1/4 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley",
      "Extra-virgin olive oil"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Crumble the saffron into the warm water and set aside.",
      "In a skillet large enough to hold all of the pasta, cook the onion and garlic in 4 tablespoons of the oil over medium heat until the onion is lightly golden, about 10 minutes. Add the calamari and cook, stirring, until the calamari are just opaque, about 2 minutes. Add the wine and salt and pepper to taste. Bring to a simmer and cook 1 minute.",
      "Stir together the remaining 1 tablespoon oil and the flour. Stir the mixture into the calamari. Bring to a simmer. Add the saffron mixture and cook 5 minutes more.",
      "Meanwhile, bring at least 4 quarts of water to a boil. Add the pasta and 2 tablespoons of salt. Stir well. Cook over high heat, stirring frequently, until the pasta is tender but slightly underdone. Drain the pasta, reserving some of the cooking water.",
      "Stir the pasta into the skillet with the calamari. Add a little of the reserved cooking water if the mixture seems dry. Stir in the parsley and mix well. Remove from the heat and drizzle with a little extra-virgin olive oil. Serve immediately."
