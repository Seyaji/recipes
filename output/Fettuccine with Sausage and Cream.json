  "yield": "Makes 4 to 6 servings",
  "introduction": "Roasted red peppers, bits of sausage, and green peas get tangled among the creamy fettuccine for great flavor in every bite. This dish comes from the Emilia-Romagna region and aims to capture the essence of Italian comfort cuisine. Meaty pork sausages without a lot of spices are best suited for this recipe.",
  "ingredients": [
    "8 ounces plain Italian pork sausages, casings removed",
    "1 cup heavy or whipping cream",
    "1/2 cup diced drained roasted red peppers",
    "1/2 cup fresh or frozen tiny peas",
    "1 tablespoon chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley",
    "Salt and freshly ground black pepper",
    "1 pound fresh fettuccine",
    "1/2 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "1. Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the sausage and cook, stirring often to break up any lumps, until no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Remove the meat to a cutting board, let cool a little, then chop finely.",
    "2. Wipe out the skillet. Pour the cream and the chopped sausage into the pan and bring it to a simmer. Stir in the roasted peppers, peas, parsley, and salt and pepper to taste. Cook 3 minutes or until the peas are tender. Turn off the heat.",
    "3. Bring at least 4 quarts of water to a boil. Add 2 tablespoons of salt, then the pasta. Stir well. Cook over high heat, stirring frequently, until the pasta is al dente, tender yet still firm to the bite. Drain the pasta, reserving some of the cooking water.",
    "4. Toss the pasta in the pan with the sauce. Add the cheese and toss again. Stir in a little of the cooking water, if necessary. Serve immediately."
