  "introduction": "Experience a different culinary journey with Dragged Pasta with Cream and Mushrooms, a unique dish inspired by the fine cuisine of Le Tre Vaselle in Torgiano, Umbria. This method of cooking pasta directly in the sauce, similar to a risotto, brings out extraordinary flavors and offers a rich, creamy experience. Enjoy it with a fine red wine from the Lungarotti family, and you'll recreate a piece of Italy in your kitchen.",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 medium onion, finely chopped",
    "6 tablespoons olive oil",
    "1 pound pennette, ditalini, or tubetti",
    "2 tablespoons Cognac",
    "5 cups hot homemade Meat Broth or Chicken Broth or 2 cups canned broth mixed with 3 cups water",
    "8 ounces sliced white mushrooms",
    "Salt and freshly ground black pepper",
    "3/4 cup heavy cream",
    "1 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano",
    "1 tablespoon chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "In a skillet large enough to hold all of the pasta, cook the onion in 2 tablespoons of the oil over medium heat until tender and golden, about 10 minutes. Scrape the onion into a dish and wipe out the pan.",
    "Pour the remaining 4 tablespoons of the oil into the pan and heat over medium heat. Add the pasta and cook, stirring often, until the pasta begins to brown, about 5 minutes. Add the Cognac and cook until it evaporates.",
    "Return the onion to the pan and stir in 2 cups of the hot broth. Turn the heat to medium-high and cook, stirring often, until most of the broth is absorbed. Stir in 2 more cups of the broth. When most of the liquid is absorbed, stir in the mushrooms. As you continue stirring, add the remaining broth a little at a time as needed to keep the pasta moist. Season to taste with salt and pepper.",
    "After about 12 minutes from when you began adding the broth, the pasta should be almost al dente, tender yet firm to the bite. Stir in the cream and simmer until slightly thickened, about 1 minute.",
    "Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the cheese. Stir in the parsley and serve immediately."
