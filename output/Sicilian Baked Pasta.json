  "instructions": [
    "1. Prepare the sauce: Pour the oil into a large saucepan. Add the onion and garlic. Cook over medium heat for 10 minutes or until the onion and garlic are tender and golden. Stir in the tomato paste and cook for 2 minutes.",
    "2. Add the tomatoes and bring to a simmer. Add salt and pepper to taste and cook for 1 hour or until the sauce is thickened, stirring occasionally. Stir in the basil.",
    "3. Prepare the filling: Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the meats, garlic, and salt and pepper to taste. Cook for 10 minutes, stirring to break up the lumps. When the meat is browned, add two cups of the prepared tomato sauce. Bring to a simmer and cook until thickened, about 20 minutes. Stir in the peas. Let cool slightly.",
    "4. Smear the butter over the bottom and sides of a 13 × 9 × 2–inch baking pan. Coat the pan with the bread crumbs, patting them so that they adhere.",
    "5. Place a rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 375°F. Bring at least 4 quarts of water to a boil in each of two large pots. Add 3 tablespoons of salt to each pot, then the pasta. Stir well. Cook over high heat, stirring frequently, until the pasta is tender but slightly underdone. Drain the pasta and return it to the pot. Toss the pasta with 3 cups of the plain tomato sauce and the grated cheeses.",
    "6. Carefully spoon half the pasta into the prepared pan, trying not to disturb the bread crumbs. Spoon the meat filling evenly over the pasta. Scatter the cheese cubes on top. Spoon the remaining pasta over all. Flatten the contents of the pan with a spoon.",
    "7. Have ready a cooling rack and a large tray or cutting board the size of the pan. Bake for 60 to 90 minutes or until the pasta is heated through and crusty on top. Let the pasta cool in the pan on the rack for 30 minutes. Slide a small knife around the edges of the pan. Protecting your hands with oven mitts, invert the pasta onto the tray or cutting board. Cut into squares and serve warm with the remaining tomato sauce."
