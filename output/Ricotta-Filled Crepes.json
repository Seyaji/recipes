  "instructions": [
    "Prepare the Ragù sauce. In a large bowl, whisk together the crepe ingredients until smooth. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes or more.",
    "Heat a 6-inch nonstick skillet or omelet pan over medium heat. Brush the pan lightly with oil. Holding the pan in one hand, spoon in about 1/3 cup of the crepe batter. Immediately lift and rotate the pan to completely cover the base with a thin layer of batter. Pour off any excess batter. Cook one minute, or until the edge of the crepe turns brown and begins to lift away from the pan. With your fingers, flip the crepe over and brown lightly on the other side. Cook 30 seconds more or until spotted with brown.",
    "Slide the cooked crepe onto a dinner plate. Repeat, making crepes with the remaining batter and stacking them one on top of the other.",
    "To make the filling, stir together all of the ingredients in a large bowl until just combined.",
    "Spoon a thin layer of the sauce in a 13 × 9 × 2– inch baking dish. To fill the crepes, place about 1/4 cup of the filling lengthwise on one side of a crepe. Roll the crepe into a cylinder and place it in the baking dish seam-side down. Continue filling and rolling the remaining crepes, placing them close together. Spoon on additional sauce. Sprinkle with cheese.",
    "Place a rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Bake 30 to 45 minutes or until the sauce is bubbling and the manicotti are heated through. Serve hot."

  "variations": "Feel free to experiment with different fillings such as spinach and ricotta or beef and ricotta for a hearty variation. You can also switch out the Neapolitan Ragù for a simple marinara sauce or a rich béchamel."
