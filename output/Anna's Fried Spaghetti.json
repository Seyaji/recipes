Perfect for a midnight snack or a casual meal, this dish shows how innovation in the kitchen can lead to culinary magic.",
    "ingredients": [
      "4 to 8 ounces cold leftover spaghetti with Sicilian Tomato Sauce or Marinara Sauce",
      "3 tablespoons olive oil",
      "2 tablespoons grated Pecorino Romano"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Prepare the spaghetti with tomato sauce if necessary. Chill at least 1 hour or overnight.",
      "In a large nonstick skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil over medium heat. Sprinkle the oil with 1 tablespoon of the cheese and immediately add the pasta to the pan, pressing it flat with the back of a spoon. The pasta should be no more than 3/4 inch deep.",
      "Cook the pasta, flattening it occasionally against the pan, until golden brown and crisp on the bottom, about 20 minutes. Slide a thin spatula underneath the pasta occasionally to make sure that it is not sticking.",
      "When the pasta is nicely browned, remove the skillet from heat. Slide a spatula under the pasta to be sure that it is not stuck. Place a large inverted plate on top of the skillet. Protecting your hands with oven mitts, invert the skillet and plate so that the pasta cake falls out of the skillet onto the plate.",
      "Add the remaining oil and cheese to the skillet. Slide the pasta cake with the crisp side up back into the pan. Cook the same way as the first side until browned and crisp, about 15 minutes more. Cut into wedges and serve hot."
