    "introduction": "Polenta 'in Chains' is a hearty and comforting dish hailing from the heart of Tuscany. This polenta is harmoniously intertwined with fresh, shredded vegetables, making it a lush vegetarian main, or a savory side to grilled meats. Rich in flavor and tradition, it solidifies beautifully when cooled and achieves a crispy golden brown exterior when fried.",

      "1 garlic clove, finely chopped",
      "2 cups shredded cabbage or kale",
