  "introduction": "Brutti ma Buoni, or 'Ugly but Good,' are delightful Piedmontese cookies that defy their quirky name. These treats combine the rich flavors of cocoa and toasted hazelnuts, utilizing a unique technique that requires a brief stovetop cooking before baking.",
  "ingredients": [
    "3 large egg whites, at room temperature",
    "Pinch of salt",
    "1 1/2 cups sugar",
    "1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder",
    "1 1/4 cups hazelnuts, toasted, peeled, and coarsely chopped"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Preheat the oven to 300Â°F. Grease 2 large baking sheets.",
    "In a large bowl, with an electric mixer at medium speed, beat the egg whites and salt until foamy. Increase the speed to high and gradually add the sugar. Beat until soft peaks form when the beaters are lifted.",
    "On low speed, mix in the cocoa. Stir in the hazelnuts.",
    "Scrape the mixture into a large heavy saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until the mixture is shiny and smooth, about 5 minutes. Be careful that it does not scorch.",
    "Immediately drop the hot batter by tablespoonfuls onto the prepared baking sheets. Bake 30 minutes or until firm and slightly cracked on the surface.",
    "While the cookies are still hot, transfer them to a rack to cool, using a thin-blade metal spatula. Store in an airtight container up to 2 weeks."
