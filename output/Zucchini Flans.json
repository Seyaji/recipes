    "yield": "Makes 6 servings",
    "introduction": "Zucchini Flans offer a delicate and savory experience, perfect as a side dish for roasts or hams during a refreshing spring brunch. These ramekin-baked delights can also make an elegant first course when served straight from the oven, puffed and airy. However, they should be served quickly as they tend to sink fast. You can experiment by substituting the zucchini with other vegetables like broccoli, asparagus, or carrots.",
    "ingredients": [
      "1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted",
      "3 medium zucchini, cut into thick slices",
      "4 large eggs, separated",
      "1/2 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano",
      "Pinch of salt",
      "Pinch of ground nutmeg"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Scrub the zucchini with a brush under cold running water. Trim off the ends.",
      "Place a rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Generously brush six 4-ounce ramekins or ovenproof custard cups with the melted butter.",
      "Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the zucchini and bring to a simmer. Cook 1 minute. Drain the zucchini well. Pat the pieces dry with paper towels. Pass the zucchini through a food mill or blend in a processor until smooth. Transfer the zucchini puree to a large bowl.",
      "Add the egg yolks, Parmigiano, salt, and nutmeg to the zucchini and stir well.",
      "In a large bowl, with an electric mixer, beat the egg whites until they hold soft peaks when the beater is lifted. With a rubber spatula, gently fold the whites into the zucchini mixture.",
      "Pour the mixture into the cups. Bake 15 to 20 minutes or until the tops are lightly spotted with brown and a knife inserted near the center comes out clean. Remove the cups from the oven. Let rest 2 minutes, then run a small knife around the inside of the cups and invert the flans onto a plate."

    "variations": "You can substitute broccoli, asparagus, carrots, or other vegetables for the zucchini."
