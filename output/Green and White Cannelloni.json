        "instructions": [
            "Prepare pasta and béchamel sauce. Put the spinach in a large pot over medium heat with 1/4 cup of water. Cover and cook 2 to 3 minutes or until wilted and tender. Drain and cool. Wrap the spinach in a lint-free cloth and squeeze out as much water as possible. Finely chop the spinach.",
            "Lay out some lint-free kitchen towels on a flat surface. Have ready a large bowl of cold water. Bring about 4 quarts of water to a boil. Add 2 tablespoons salt. Add the pasta squares a few pieces at a time. Cook the pasta until tender but slightly underdone. Scoop the pasta out of the water and place it in the cold water. When cool enough to handle, lay the pasta sheets out flat on the towels, which can be stacked one on top of the other. Continue cooking and cooling the remaining pasta in the same way.",
            "Stir together the spinach, ricotta, eggs, 1/2 cup of the Parmigiano, the nutmeg, and salt and pepper to taste. Stir in the fontina.",
            "Place a rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 375°F. Butter a 13 × 9 × 2–inch baking dish.",
            "Spread about 1/4 cup of the filling at one end of each pasta square. Roll up the pasta, starting with the filled end. Place the cannelloni seamside down in the pan.",
            "Spread the sauce over the pasta. Sprinkle with the remaining 1 cup of Parmigiano. Bake 20 minutes or until lightly browned."
