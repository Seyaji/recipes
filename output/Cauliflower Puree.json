  "introduction": "This delightful Cauliflower Puree combines the creamy texture of mashed potatoes with the light, flavorful qualities of cauliflower. It's a fantastic alternative to traditional mashed potatoes and pairs beautifully with hearty dishes like braised beef shank.",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 small cauliflower (about 1 pound)",
    "3 medium boiling potatoes, peeled and quartered",
    "Salt",
    "1 tablespoon unsalted butter",
    "2 tablespoons grated Parmigiano-Reggiano",
    "Freshly ground black pepper"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Cut the cauliflower into 2-inch florets. Trim off the ends of the stems. Cut thick stems crosswise into 1/4-inch slices.",
    "In a pot large enough to hold all the vegetables, combine the potatoes with 3 quarts cold water and salt to taste. Bring to a simmer and cook 5 minutes.",
    "Add the cauliflower and cook until the vegetables are very tender, about 10 minutes. Drain the cauliflower and potatoes. Blend them until smooth with an electric mixer or hand-held blender. Do not overbeat them or the potatoes will become gluey.",
    "Stir in the butter, cheese, and salt and pepper to taste. Serve hot."
