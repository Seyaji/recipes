    "introduction": "Coffee Granita, known as Granita di Caffè in Italy, is a refreshing iced dessert perfect for summer. This delightful treat, which hails from the famous Caffè Tazza d'Oro near the Pantheon in Rome, combines the robust flavors of espresso with the cooling texture of ice, making it an ideal end to a meal.",
    "ingredients": [
      "4 cups water",
      "5 heaping teaspoons instant espresso powder",
      "2 to 4 tablespoons sugar",
      "Whipped cream (optional)"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "1. Place a 13 × 9 × 2–inch pan in the freezer to chill. Bring the water to a boil. Remove from heat and stir in the instant espresso powder and sugar to taste. Let cool slightly, then cover. Refrigerate until chilled, about 1 hour.",
      "2. Remove the chilled pan from the freezer and pour the coffee into the pan. Freeze until a 1-inch border of ice crystals forms around the edges. Stir the ice crystals into the center. Return the pan to the freezer and continue freezing, stirring every 30 minutes, until all of the liquid is frozen, about 2 to 2.5 hours.",
