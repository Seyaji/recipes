    "ingredients": [
      "2 live lobsters, about 1¼ pounds each",
      "⅓ cup olive oil",
      "2 large garlic cloves, lightly crushed",
      "Pinch of crushed red pepper",
      "1 cup dry white wine",
      "1 (28-ounce) can peeled tomatoes, drained and chopped",
      "6 fresh basil leaves, torn into bits",
      "Salt"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Place one of the lobsters on a cutting board with the cavity facing up. Do not remove the bands that keep the claws shut. Protect your hand with a heavy towel or pot holder and hold the lobster above the tail. Plunge the tip of a heavy chef's knife into the body where the tail joins the chest. Cut all the way through, separating the tail from the rest of the body. Use poultry shears to remove the thin shell that covers the tail meat. Pull out and remove the dark vein in the tail, but leave the green tomalley and red coral, if any. Repeat with the second lobster. Cut the tail crosswise into 3 or 4 pieces. Set the tail pieces aside. Cut the lobster bodies and claws at the joints into 1- to 2-inch chunks. Smack the claws with the blunt side of the knife to crack them.",
      "In a large heavy saucepan, heat the oil over medium heat. Add all the lobster pieces except the tails and cook, stirring often, for 10 minutes. Scatter the garlic and hot pepper around the pieces. Add the wine and cook 1 minute.",
      "Add the tomatoes, basil, and salt. Bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes are thickened, about 25 minutes. Add the lobster tails and cook 5 to 10 minutes more or until the tail meat is firm and opaque. Serve immediately."
