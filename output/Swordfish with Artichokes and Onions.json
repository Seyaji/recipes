  "introduction": "Artichokes and swordfish are a delightful pairing in this Sicilian-inspired dish. The artichokes bring a tender, slightly nutty flavor that perfectly complements the rich, meaty swordfish steaks. The addition of onions and a savory tomato-anchovy sauce melds everything together into a harmonious, flavorful meal that evokes the vibrant cuisine of Sicily.",
  "ingredients": [
    "2 medium artichokes",
    "2 tablespoons olive oil",
    "4 thick swordfish, tuna, or shark steaks",
    "Salt and freshly ground black pepper",
    "2 medium onions",
    "4 anchovy fillets, chopped",
    "1/4 cup tomato paste",
    "1 cup water",
    "1/2 teaspoon dried oregano"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Trim the artichokes down to the central cone of pale green leaves. With a small paring knife, peel the base and stems of the artichokes. Slice off the stem ends. Cut the artichokes in half lengthwise. Scoop out the chokes. Cut the hearts into thin slices.",
    "In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium heat. Pat the swordfish dry and cook until browned on both sides, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Remove the fish to a plate.",
    "Add the onions and artichokes to the pan. Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the onions are wilted, about 5 minutes. Stir in the anchovies, tomato paste, water, oregano, and salt and pepper to taste. Bring to a simmer and lower the heat. Cook 20 minutes or until the vegetables are tender, stirring occasionally.",
    "Push the vegetables to the outside edge of the pan and return the fish to the skillet. Baste the fish with the sauce. Cook 1 to 2 minutes or until the fish is heated through. Serve immediately."
