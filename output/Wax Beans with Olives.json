    "introduction": "Shiny black olives and green parsley provide a vibrant color contrast to the pale yellow wax beans in this dish. This preparation also works well with green beans, and substituting olive oil for butter lets you serve it at room temperature without it firming up.",
    "ingredients": [
      "1 pound yellow wax or green beans",
      "Salt",
      "3 tablespoons unsalted butter",
      "1 small onion, chopped",
      "1 garlic clove, finely chopped",
      "1/2 cup mild black olives, such as Gaeta, pitted and chopped",
      "2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley"

Cook uncovered until the beans are crisp-tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Rinse the beans under cold water and drain well. Pat dry. Cut the beans into 1-inch pieces."
