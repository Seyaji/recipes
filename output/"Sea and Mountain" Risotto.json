In Italy, this enchanting maremonti combination signifies elements from both the sea and mountains, bringing a unique depth of flavors to your table.",
  "ingredients": [
    "6 cups store-bought vegetable broth or water",
    "3 tablespoons unsalted butter",
    "1/4 cup finely chopped shallots",
    "10 ounces cremini or white mushrooms, thinly sliced",
    "Salt and freshly ground black pepper",
    "2 cups medium-grain rice, such as Arborio, Carnaroli, or Vialone Nano",
    "12 ounces shelled and deveined shrimp, cut into 1/2-inch pieces",
    "1/2 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "In a large pot, bring the broth to a simmer over medium heat, then lower the heat so that it just keeps the broth hot. In a wide heavy saucepan, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter over medium heat. Add the shallots and mushrooms. Cook, stirring frequently, until the juices evaporate and the mushrooms begin to turn brown, about 10 minutes. Stir in salt and pepper to taste.",
    "Add the rice and cook, stirring with a wooden spoon until hot, about 2 minutes. Add 1/2 cup of the hot broth and stir until the liquid is absorbed. Continue adding the broth 1/2 cup at a time, stirring after each addition. Adjust the heat so that the liquid simmers rapidly but the rice does not stick to the pan. About halfway through the cooking, stir in the shrimp and salt and pepper to taste.",
    "Use only as much of the broth as needed until the rice becomes tender yet firm to the bite and the risotto is creamy. When you think it may be done, taste a few grains. If not ready, test again in a minute or so. If the broth runs out before the rice is tender, use hot water. Cooking time is 18 to 20 minutes.",
    "Remove the risotto pan from the heat. Stir in the remaining 1 tablespoon butter. Stir in the cheese and serve immediately."
