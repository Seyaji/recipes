    "introduction": "Cavatelli with Garlicky Greens and Potatoes is a delightful Italian dish where earthy greens meet tender pasta and potatoes. The combination of different varieties of greens adds a unique texture and flavor contrast, while the potatoes contribute a creamy smoothness that makes each bite irresistibly comforting.",
    "ingredients": [
      "1.5 pounds assorted greens, such as broccoli rabe, mizuna, mustard, kale, or dandelions, trimmed",
      "Salt",
      "1/3 cup olive oil",
      "4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced",
      "Pinch of crushed red pepper",
      "Salt and freshly ground black pepper",
      "1 pound cavatelli",
      "1 pound boiling potatoes, peeled and chopped into 1/2-inch pieces"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Fill a sink or large bowl with cool water. Add the greens and swirl them in the water. Transfer the greens to a colander, change the water, then repeat at least two more times to eliminate all traces of sand.",
      "Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the greens and salt to taste. Cook until the greens are tender, 5 to 10 minutes, depending on the varieties you use. Drain the greens and let them cool slightly under cold running water. Chop the greens into bite-size pieces.",
      "Pour the oil into a skillet large enough to hold the cooked pasta. Add the garlic and crushed red pepper. Cook over medium heat until the garlic is golden, 2 minutes. Add the greens and a pinch of salt. Cook, stirring, until the vegetables are coated with oil, about 5 minutes.",
      "Bring at least 4 quarts of water to a boil in a large pot. Add 2 tablespoons of salt, then the pasta. Cook, stirring frequently, until the water returns to a boil. Add the potatoes and cook until the pasta is al dente, tender yet firm to the bite. Set aside some of the cooking water. Drain the pasta.",
      "Add the pasta and potatoes to the greens and toss well. Add a little of the reserved cooking water if the pasta seems dry. Serve immediately."
