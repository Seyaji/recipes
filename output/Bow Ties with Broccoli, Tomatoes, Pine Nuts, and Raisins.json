        "introduction": "Pine nuts add a pleasant crunch and raisins bring sweetness to this delicious Sicilian pasta. The broccoli is cooked in the same pot as the pasta, so their flavors really come together. If you find yourself with large round tomatoes instead of the plum variety, you can substitute them, though the sauce will be thinner and may need slightly longer cooking.",

            "1⁄3 cup olive oil",
            "2 garlic cloves, finely chopped",

            "2 1⁄2 pounds fresh plum tomatoes (about 15), peeled, seeded, and chopped",
            "Salt and freshly ground black pepper",
            "2 tablespoons raisins",
            "1 pound farfalle",
            "1 medium bunch of broccoli, stems removed and cut into small florets",
