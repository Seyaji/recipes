        "titleAlternative": "Panzerotti or Crocche",
        "yield": "Makes about 24",
        "introduction": "In Naples, pizzerias often set up sidewalk stands to sell these delectable logs of mashed potatoes encased in a crispy bread-crumb coating, making them a popular choice for lunch or a snack on the go. This recipe, however, is my grandmother's version, traditionally enjoyed during holidays and festive occasions, often served as a side dish with roast beef.",
        "ingredients": [
            "2 1/2 pounds all-purpose potatoes, such as Yukon gold",
            "3 large eggs",
            "1 cup freshly grated Pecorino Romano or Parmigiano-Reggiano",
            "2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley",
            "1/4 cup finely chopped salame (about 2 ounces)",
            "Salt and freshly ground black pepper",
            "2 cups plain dry bread crumbs",
            "Vegetable oil for frying"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Scrub the potatoes with a brush under cold running water. Place the potatoes in a large saucepan with cold water to cover. Cover the pan and bring the water to a boil. Cook over medium heat until the potatoes are tender when pierced with a fork, about 20 minutes. Drain the potatoes, then let them cool slightly. Peel the potatoes. Put them in a large bowl and mash them with a masher or fork until smooth.",
            "Separate the eggs, putting the yolks in a small bowl and setting the whites aside in a shallow dish. Spread the bread crumbs on a sheet of wax paper.",
            "Stir the egg yolks, cheese, parsley, and salame into the mashed potatoes. Add salt and pepper to taste.",
            "Using about 1/4 cup of the potato mixture, form a sausage shape about 1 inch wide and 2 1/2 inches long. Repeat with the remaining potatoes.",
            "Beat the egg whites with a whisk or a fork until frothy. Dip the potato logs into the whites, then roll them in the crumbs, coating them completely. Place the logs on a wire rack and let dry 15 to 30 minutes.",
            "Pour about 1/2 inch of the oil into a large heavy skillet. Heat over medium heat until a bit of the egg white sizzles when dropped in the oil. Carefully place some of the logs in the pan, leaving a little space between them. Fry them, turning occasionally with tongs, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Transfer the browned croquettes to paper towels to drain.",
            "Serve immediately or keep the croquettes warm in a low oven while frying the remainder."
