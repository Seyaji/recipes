  "titleAlternative": "Zuppa di Pesce alla Marinara",
  "yield": "Makes 6 servings",
  "introduction": "Molise-style fish stew is unique due to its substantial use of sweet green peppers, making it stand out from other regional fish stews. While the ideal preparation includes a variety of seafood, this dish can be made with just calamari and monkfish and still deliver a delightful taste. Traditional Molise recipes might feature lobster, octopus, and rockfish or other firm-fleshed varieties.",
  "ingredients": [
    "1/4 cup olive oil",
    "1 1/2 pounds Italian frying peppers, seeded and chopped",
    "1 onion, chopped",
    "Salt",
    "2 tablespoons red wine vinegar",
    "1/2 pound calamari (squid), cut into rings",
    "1 pound firm whitefish steaks or fillets, cut into 2-inch chunks",
    "1/2 pound medium shrimp, shelled, deveined, and cut into 1/2-inch pieces",
    "2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley",
    "6 to 12 slices of Italian bread, toasted",
    "Extra-virgin olive oil"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "In a large saucepan, heat the oil over medium heat. Stir in the peppers, onion, and salt to taste. Cover and reduce the heat to low. Cook, stirring occasionally, until very tender, about 40 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool.",
    "Scrape the contents of the pan into a food processor or blender. Process until smooth. Add the vinegar and salt to taste and process again briefly to blend.",
    "Scrape the pepper and onion mixture back into the saucepan. Add 1 to 2 cups water or enough to make the liquid as thick as heavy cream. Bring it to a simmer over medium-low heat. Add the calamari and cook until tender when pierced with a fork, about 20 minutes.",
    "Add the fish chunks and the shrimp. Cook until the fish is just cooked, about 5 minutes. Stir in the parsley. Serve hot with toasted bread and a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil."
