  "titleAlternative": "Spumone di Arancia",
  "yield": "Makes 6 servings",
  "introduction": "Orange Spumone is derived from the Italian word 'spuma,' meaning 'foam.' This dessert offers a richer and creamier texture than regular gelato, owing its smooth consistency to the hot sugar syrup and egg yolks used to create a thick custard. The combination of airy egg foam and whipped cream results in a light and delightful treat.",
  "ingredients": [
    "3 navel oranges",
    "1 cup water",
    "3/4 cup sugar",
    "6 large egg yolks",
    "1 cup chilled heavy or whipping cream"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Grate the zest from the oranges and squeeze the juice. (There should be 3 tablespoons of the zest and 2/3 cup of juice.)",
    "In a medium saucepan, combine the water and sugar. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, then cook, stirring occasionally, until the sugar dissolves.",
    "In a large heatproof bowl, whisk the egg yolks until blended. Slowly add the hot sugar syrup in a thin stream, whisking constantly. Pour the mixture into the saucepan and cook over low heat, stirring with a wooden spoon, until slightly thickened and the mixture lightly coats the spoon.",
    "Pour the mixture through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl. Stir in the orange juice and zest. Let cool, then cover and refrigerate until chilled, at least 1 hour. Place a large bowl and the beaters of an electric mixer in the refrigerator.",
    "Just before serving, remove the bowl and beaters from the refrigerator. Pour the cream into the bowl and whip the cream at high speed until it holds its shape softly when the beaters are lifted, about 4 minutes. With a flexible spatula, gently fold the cream into the orange mixture.",
    "Freeze in an ice-cream freezer according to the manufacturer's instructions. Pack into a container, cover, and freeze. Serve within 24 hours."
