  "introduction": "Fried Calamari is a beloved dish that combines the irresistible appeal of crispy textures with the mild, oceanic flavor of squid. Often enjoyed as a snack or appetizer, this dish is a staple in coastal cuisines, particularly in Italy. With a light dusting of flour and quick frying, the calamari achieves a sheer, crisp finish that's hard to resist. Served hot with a squeeze of lemon, it's a dish that many people enjoy even without realizing they're eating squid.",
  "ingredients": [
    "2 pounds cleaned calamari (squid)",
    "1 cup all-purpose flour",
    "1 teaspoon salt",
    "Freshly ground black pepper",
    "Olive or vegetable oil for frying",
    "1 lemon, cut into wedges"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Make a small slit at the pointed end of each calamari. Rinse thoroughly, letting the water run through the body sac. Drain and pat dry. Cut the bodies crosswise into 1/2-inch rings. If large, cut the base of each group of tentacles in half. Pat dry.",
    "Spread the flour on a sheet of wax paper and season with salt and pepper. Line a tray with paper towels.",
    "Pour oil to a depth of 2 inches in a deep heavy saucepan, or fill a deep-fryer according to the manufacturer's directions. Heat the oil to 370Â°F on a frying thermometer or until a small piece of the calamari placed in the oil sizzles and browns lightly in 1 minute.",
    "When the correct temperature is reached, lightly roll a few pieces of calamari in the flour mixture. Shake off the excess flour. Slip the pieces into the hot oil with tongs without crowding the pan. Cook until the calamari turn lightly golden, about 3 minutes.",
    "With a slotted spoon, transfer the calamari to the paper towels. Repeat with the remaining calamari. Sprinkle with salt. Serve hot with lemon wedges."
