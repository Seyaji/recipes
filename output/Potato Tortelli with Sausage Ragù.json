        "titleAlternative": "Tortelli di Patate al Ragù di Salsiccia",
        "yield": "Makes 6 to 8 servings",
        "introduction": "Mashed potatoes flavored with Parmigiano-Reggiano fill fresh pasta rings in southern Emilia-Romagna and northern Tuscany. Instead of squares, these tortelli start as circles of dough shaped into rings. They're best served with a rich Sausage Ragù, or you can enjoy them with Butter and Sage Sauce.",
        "ingredients": [
            "4 1⁄2 cups Sausage Ragù",
            "3 medium boiling potatoes",
            "2 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature",
            "1 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano",
            "1⁄8 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg",
            "Salt and freshly ground black pepper",
            "1 pound Fresh Egg Pasta, rolled out and cut into 4-inch strips"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Prepare the ragù. Then, place the whole potatoes in a pot with cold water to cover. Bring to a simmer and cook until the potatoes are tender when pierced with a knife, about 20 minutes. Drain and let cool.",
            "Peel the potatoes and mash them with a ricer or food mill until smooth. Stir in the butter, 1⁄2 cup of the cheese, the nutmeg, and salt and pepper to taste.",
            "Sprinkle two baking sheets with flour.",
            "Prepare the pasta. With a 2-inch round cookie or biscuit cutter, or a small glass, cut the dough into circles. Place a teaspoon of the filling on one side of each circle. Dip a fingertip in cool water and moisten the dough circle halfway around. Fold the dough over the filling to form a semicircle. Press the edges firmly together to seal. Gather the two corners of the dough and pinch them together. Place the tortelli on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling.",
            "Cover and refrigerate, turning the pieces occasionally, up to 3 hours. (For longer storage, freeze the pasta on the baking sheets. Transfer to heavy-duty plastic bags. Seal tightly and freeze up to one month. Do not thaw before cooking.)",
            "When ready to cook the tortelli, bring at least 4 quarts of water to a boil. Bring the sauce to a simmer. Add the pasta to the boiling water with salt to taste. Stir well. Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the pasta is tender yet still firm to the bite.",
            "Spoon some of the sauce into a heated serving bowl. Drain the pasta well and add it to the bowl. Top with the remaining sauce and 1⁄2 cup cheese. Serve immediately."
        ],
        "variations": [
          "Try using a different kind of cheese for the filling, like Gruyère or Pecorino.",
          "Serve with Butter and Sage Sauce instead of Sausage Ragù for a lighter option."
