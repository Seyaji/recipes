  "introduction": "Chocolate Chip Rice Pudding is a luscious dessert that combines the creamy texture of rice pudding with the delightful surprise of bittersweet chocolate chunks. Originating from Bologna, where rice-based desserts are a tradition, this pudding is lightened with whipped cream, making it both rich and airy. Perfect on its own or elevated with a raspberry or warm chocolate sauce.",
  "ingredients": [
    "6 cups whole milk",
    "3/4 cup medium-grain rice, such as Arborio, Carnaroli or Vialone Nano",
    "1/2 teaspoon salt",
    "3/4 cup sugar",
    "2 tablespoons dark rum or cognac",
    "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract",
    "1 cup heavy or whipping cream",
    "3 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "In a large saucepan, combine the milk, rice, and salt. Bring the milk to a simmer and cook, stirring frequently, until the rice is very tender and the milk is absorbed, about 35 minutes.",
    "Transfer the cooked rice to a large bowl. Stir in the sugar and let cool to room temperature. Stir in the rum and vanilla.",
    "At least 20 minutes before you are ready to make the dessert, place a large bowl and the beaters of an electric mixer in the refrigerator.",
    "When chilled, remove the bowl and beaters from the refrigerator. Pour the cream into the bowl and whip the cream at high speed until it holds its shape softly when the beaters are lifted, about 4 minutes.",
    "With a flexible spatula, fold the whipped cream and chopped chocolate into the rice mixture. Serve immediately or cover and chill in the refrigerator."
