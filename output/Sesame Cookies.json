        "introduction": "Sicilians call these 'regina,' or 'queen,' cookies because they are high esteemed. Despite their plain look, the toasty sesame flavor of these cookies is purely addictive. You can hardly stop at just one.",
        "ingredients": [
            "4 cups all-purpose flour",
            "1 cup sugar",
            "1 tablespoon baking powder",
            "1 teaspoon salt",
            "1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature",
            "1/2 cup solid vegetable shortening",
            "2 large eggs, at room temperature",
            "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract",
            "1 teaspoon grated lemon zest",
            "2 cups unhulled sesame seeds",
            "1/2 cup milk"

        "instructions": [
            "Preheat the oven to 375Â°F. Grease and flour two large baking sheets or line them with parchment.",
            "In a large electric mixer bowl, stir together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. On low speed, stir in the butter and shortening a little at a time until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.",
            "In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs, vanilla, and lemon zest. Stir the egg mixture into the dry ingredients until smooth and well blended, about 2 minutes. Cover the dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate 1 hour.",
            "Spread the sesame seeds on a piece of wax paper. Put the milk in a small bowl next to the sesame seeds.",
            "Take the dough out of the refrigerator. Scoop out a portion of the dough the size of a golf ball and shape it into a log 2 1/2 inches long and 3/4 inch wide. Dip the log in the milk, then roll it in the sesame seeds. Place the log on the baking sheet and flatten slightly with your fingers. Continue with the remaining dough, placing the logs 1 inch apart.",
            "Bake 25 to 30 minutes or until well browned. Have ready 2 large cooling racks.",
            "Transfer the baking sheets to the racks. Let the cookies cool 5 minutes on the baking sheets, then transfer them to the racks to cool completely. Store in an airtight container up to 2 weeks."
