  "titleAlternative": "Coniglio in Porchetta",
  "yield": "Makes 4 servings",
  "introduction": "Imagine the savory flavors of traditional roast pork, now applied to tender rabbit. This recipe hails from the Marches region, where wild fennel is a popular ingredient. With a delightful mix of pancetta, garlic, and aromatic herbs, this dish brings a unique twist to your table.",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 rabbit (2 1/2 to 3 pounds), cut into 8 pieces",
    "Salt and freshly ground black pepper",
    "2 tablespoons olive oil",
    "2 ounces pancetta",
    "3 garlic cloves, finely chopped",
    "2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary",
    "1 tablespoon fennel seeds",
    "2 or 3 sage leaves",
    "1 bay leaf",
    "1 cup dry white wine",
    "1/2 cup water"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Rinse the rabbit pieces and pat them dry with paper towels. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.",
    "In a skillet large enough to hold the rabbit pieces in a single layer, heat the oil over medium heat. Place the pieces in the pan. Scatter the pancetta all around. Cook until the rabbit is browned on one side, about 8 minutes.",
    "Turn the rabbit and scatter the garlic, rosemary, fennel, sage, and bay leaf all around. When the rabbit is browned on the second side, after about 7 minutes, add the wine and stir, scraping the bottom of the pan. Simmer the wine for 1 minute.",
    "Cook uncovered, turning the meat occasionally, until the rabbit is very tender and coming away from the bone, about 30 minutes. (Add a little water if the pan becomes too dry.)",
    "Discard the bay leaf. Transfer the rabbit to a serving platter and serve hot with the pan juices."

  "variations": [
    "Substitute the rabbit with chicken pieces for a different take on this dish.",
    "Use boneless pork loin instead of rabbit for a more traditional porchetta flavor."
