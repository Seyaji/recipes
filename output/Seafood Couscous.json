  "instructions": [
    "Bring the broth and water to a boil. Place the couscous in a heat-proof bowl and stir in 3 cups of the liquid and salt to taste. Set the remaining liquid aside. Cover the couscous and let stand until the liquid is absorbed, about 10 minutes. Fluff the couscous with a fork.",
    "Pour the oil into a pot large enough to hold the fish in a single layer. Add the onion and garlic. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until tender, about 10 minutes. Add the bay leaf and cook 1 minute more. Add the tomatoes, 2 tablespoons of the parsley, the cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, saffron, and cayenne. Cook for 5 minutes. Add 2 cups water and salt and pepper to taste. Bring to a simmer.",
    "Meanwhile, remove any skin or bones from the fish. Cut the fish into 2-inch chunks.",
    "Add the fish to the pot. Cover and cook 5 to 10 minutes, or until the fish is just barely opaque in the thickest part. With a slotted spoon, transfer the fish to a warm plate. Cover and keep warm.",
    "Add the couscous to the pot. Cover and cook 5 minutes, or until hot. Taste and adjust seasoning. Add some of the reserved broth if the couscous seems dry.",
    "Spoon the couscous onto a deep serving platter. Top with the fish. Sprinkle with the remaining parsley and serve immediately."
