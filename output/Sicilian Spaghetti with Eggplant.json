  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Layer the eggplant slices in a colander set over a plate, sprinkling each layer with salt. Let stand 30 to 60 minutes. Rinse the eggplant and pat very dry with paper towels.",
    "Pour about 1/2 inch of oil into a deep, heavy skillet. Heat the oil over medium heat until a small piece of the eggplant sizzles when placed in the pan. Fry the eggplant slices a few at a time until golden brown on both sides. Drain on paper towels.",
    "Pour 3 tablespoons of the oil into a medium saucepan. Add the garlic and crushed red pepper and cook over medium heat until the garlic is deep golden, about 4 minutes. Remove the garlic. Add the tomatoes and salt to taste. Reduce the heat to low and simmer 20 to 30 minutes or until the sauce is thickened. Stir in the basil and turn off the heat.",
    "Bring at least 4 quarts of water to a boil in a large pot. Add 2 tablespoons of salt, then the pasta. Stir well. Cook over high heat, stirring frequently, until the pasta is al dente, tender but still firm to the bite. Set aside some of the cooking water. Drain the pasta.",
    "Toss the pasta with the sauce in a warm serving bowl, adding a little of the cooking water if needed. Add the cheese and toss again. Top with the eggplant slices and serve immediately."
