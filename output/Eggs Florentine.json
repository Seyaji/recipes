  "introduction": "Eggs Florentine is a delightful dish that brings a taste of Florence to your table. Unlike the buttery and rich hollandaise sauce version commonly found in the United States, this recipe uses garlic and olive oil to cook the spinach, topped with a light sprinkling of Parmigiano-Reggiano. This is a lighter preparation that is perfect for a casual brunch.",
  "ingredients": [
    "3 pounds spinach, tough stems removed",
    "Salt",
    "2 tablespoons olive oil",
    "1 garlic clove, finely chopped",
    "Freshly ground black pepper",
    "8 eggs",
    "2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "1. Wash the spinach well in several changes of cold water. Put the spinach, 1/2 cup water, and a pinch of salt into a large pot. Cover the pot and turn on the heat to medium. Cook 5 minutes or until the spinach is wilted and tender. Drain the spinach and press out the excess water.",
    "2. Pour the oil into a large skillet. Add the garlic and cook until golden, about 2 minutes.",
    "3. Stir in the spinach and salt and pepper to taste. Cook, stirring occasionally, until heated through, about 2 minutes.",
    "4. Break an egg into a small cup. With a spoon, make an indentation in the spinach. Slide the egg into the indentation. Repeat with the remaining eggs.",
    "5. Sprinkle the eggs with salt and pepper and the cheese. Cover the skillet and cook 2 to 3 minutes or until the eggs are set to taste. Serve hot."
