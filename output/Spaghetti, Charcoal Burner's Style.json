  "introduction": "This classic Roman pasta dish, inspired by the hard-working charcoal delivery man, is known for its quick preparation and rich flavor. The generous grinding of black pepper is said to resemble specks of coal dust. In the traditional Roman recipe, no cream is addedâ€”just pancetta or guanciale, eggs, cheese, and black pepper create a creamy, indulgent sauce.",
  "ingredients": [
    "4 ounces pancetta, cut into thick slices",
    "1 tablespoon olive oil",
    "3 large eggs",
    "Salt and freshly ground black pepper",
    "1 pound spaghetti or linguine",
    "3/4 cup freshly grated Pecorino Romano or Parmigiano-Reggiano"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Cut the pancetta into 1/4-inch pieces. Pour the oil into a skillet large enough to hold all of the cooked pasta. Add the pancetta. Cook over medium heat, until the pancetta is golden around the edges, about 10 minutes. Turn off the heat.",
    "In a medium bowl, beat the eggs with a generous amount of salt and pepper.",
    "Bring at least 4 quarts of water to a boil in a large pot. Add 2 tablespoons of salt, then the pasta, gently pushing it down until the pasta is completely covered with water. Stir well. Cook over high heat, stirring frequently, until the pasta is al dente, tender yet still firm to the bite. Drain the pasta, reserving some of the cooking water.",
    "Place the cooked pasta in the pan with the pancetta and toss well over medium heat. Add the eggs and a little of the cooking water. Toss gently until the pasta looks creamy. Sprinkle with cheese and more pepper. Toss well and serve immediately."
