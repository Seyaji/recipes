    "introduction": "Shrimp cooked in a garlicky butter sauce is a delightful dish often found in Italian-American restaurants. Known as 'shrimp scampi' in some circles, its roots are not traditionally Italian. The term 'scampi' actually refers to a type of shellfish similar to miniature lobsters, typically grilled with olive oil, parsley, and lemon. Regardless of its nomenclature or origins, shrimp in garlic sauce is undeniably delicious and best enjoyed with plenty of bread to soak up the flavorful sauce.",
