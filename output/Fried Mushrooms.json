  "introduction": "A crisp bread-crumb crust coats these mushrooms, making them perfect as appetizers.",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 cup plain dry bread crumbs",
    "1/4 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano",
    "2 large eggs, beaten",
    "Salt and freshly ground black pepper",
    "1 pound fresh white mushrooms",
    "Vegetable oil for frying",
    "Lemon wedges"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "On a piece of wax paper, toss the bread crumbs with the cheese and spread the mixture on a sheet of wax paper.",
    "In a small bowl, beat the eggs with salt and pepper to taste.",
    "Quickly rinse the mushrooms under cold water. Pat them dry. Cut them in half or into quarters if large. Dip the mushrooms in the egg mixture and roll them in the bread crumbs, coating them completely. Let the coating dry for about 10 minutes.",
    "Line a tray with paper towels. In a deep wide saucepan, heat the oil until a small drop of the egg mixture sizzles and cooks quickly. Add just enough mushrooms to the pan as will fit in a single layer without crowding. Fry the mushrooms until crisp and brown, about 4 minutes. Transfer to the paper towels to drain. Fry the remaining mushrooms in the same way.",
    "Serve the mushrooms hot with lemon wedges."
