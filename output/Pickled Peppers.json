    "Stand the peppers on a cutting board. Holding the stem in one hand, place the cutting edge of a large heavy chef's knife just beyond the edge of the cap. Cut straight down. Turn the pepper 90Â° and cut straight down again. Repeat, turning and cutting the remaining two sides. Discard the core, seeds, and stem, which will be in one piece. Cut away any membranes and scrape out any seeds. Cut the peppers lengthwise into 1-inch strips. Place the peppers in a colander set over a plate and sprinkle with salt. Let stand 1 hour to drain.",
