  "ingredients": [
    "1Â½ pounds cleaned calamari (squid)",
    "2 garlic cloves, minced",
    "2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley",
    "5 tablespoons olive oil",
    "2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice",
    "Salt and freshly ground black pepper",
    "1 large bunch arugula",
    "1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar",
    "1 cup cherry or grape tomatoes, halved"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Slit the calamari lengthwise and open them flat. With a sharp knife, score the bodies, making diagonal lines about 1/4-inch apart. Turn the knife and make diagonal lines in the opposite direction, forming a crisscross pattern. Cut each squid into 2-inch squares. Cut the base of each group of tentacles in half. Rinse and drain the pieces and put them in a bowl.",
    "Add the garlic, parsley, 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, the lemon juice, and salt and pepper to taste, and toss well. Cover and marinate up to 3 hours ahead of cooking.",
    "Transfer the squid and marinade into a large skillet. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, just until the squid are opaque, about 5 minutes.",
    "Trim the tough stems of the arugula and discard any yellowed or bruised leaves. Wash the arugula in several changes of cool water. Dry very well. Tear the arugula into bite-size pieces. Arrange the arugula on a platter.",
    "In a small bowl, whisk together the remaining 3 tablespoons oil and the vinegar, and salt and pepper to taste. Pour over the arugula and toss well. Spoon the squid over the arugula. Scatter the tomatoes on top and serve immediately."
