    "Add the wine and cook 1 minute until evaporated.",
    "Add the tomatoes, thyme, salt, and pepper to taste. Reduce the heat to low. Cook, stirring occasionally, 40 minutes or until the sauce is thick and the vegetables are very tender. If the mixture becomes too dry, stir in some water. Remove the thyme.",
    "Bring at least 4 quarts of water to a boil in a large pot. Add 2 tablespoons of salt, then the pasta. Stir well. Cook over high heat, stirring frequently, until the pasta is al dente, tender yet still firm to the bite. Set aside some of the cooking water. Drain the pasta and transfer it to a warm serving bowl.",
    "Spoon on the sauce and toss well, adding a little of the cooking water if needed. Drizzle with some extra-virgin olive oil, and toss again. Serve immediately."
