  "instructions": [
    "Scrub the zucchini with a brush under cold running water. Trim off the ends. Cut the zucchini into 2 × 1/4 × 1/4–inch strips.",
    "Spread the flour on a sheet of wax paper. In a medium shallow bowl, beat the eggs until foamy. Beat in the beer until well blended.",
    "Pour about 2 inches of the oil into a deep heavy saucepan or into a deep-fryer following the manufacturer's instructions. Heat the oil over medium heat until a drop of egg mixture sizzles when added to the pan and the temperature reaches 370°F on a frying thermometer.",
    "Dredge about one-quarter of the zucchini strips in flour, then dip them in the egg mixture.",
    "Holding the zucchini with tongs, let the excess batter drip off, then place the zucchini in the oil one piece at a time. Add only as many as will fit without crowding. Fry the zucchini until crisp and golden brown, about 2 minutes. Remove the zucchini with a slotted spoon. Drain on paper towels. Keep warm in a low oven while frying the remainder.",
    "Sprinkle with salt and serve hot."
