  "yield": "Makes 8 servings",
  "introduction": "Juicy oranges in a sweet syrup are a perfect dessert after a rich meal. Arranged on a platter, the oranges look very pretty with their topping of orange zest strips and glistening syrup. During winter, when oranges are at their peak, this dish shines. For a variation, consider combining the oranges with ripe pineapple slices and using the orange syrup over everything.",
  "ingredients": [
    "8 large navel oranges",
    "1 1/4 cups sugar",
    "2 tablespoons orange brandy or liqueur"

    {
      "step": 1,
      "instruction": "Scrub the oranges with a brush. Trim off the ends. With a vegetable peeler, peel off the colored part of the orange skin (the zest) in wide strips. Avoid digging into the bitter white pith. Stack the zest strips and cut them into narrow matchstick pieces."

    {
      "step": 2,
      "instruction": "Remove the white pith from the oranges. Place the oranges on a serving platter."

      "step": 3,
      "instruction": "Bring a small saucepan of water to a boil. Add the orange zest and bring to a simmer. Cook 1 minute. Drain the zest and rinse under cool water. Repeat. (This will help to remove some of the bitterness from the zest.)"
    },
    {
      "step": 4,
      "instruction": "Place the sugar and 1/4 cup of water in another small saucepan over medium heat. Bring the mixture to a boil. Cook until the sugar is melted and the syrup thickens, about 3 minutes. Stir in the orange zest and cook 3 minutes more. Let cool."
    },
    {
      "step": 5,
      "instruction": "Add the orange brandy to the contents of the pot. With a fork, remove the orange zest from the syrup and pile it on top of the oranges. Spoon on the syrup. Cover and chill up to 3 hours until ready to serve."
