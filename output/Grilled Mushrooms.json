        "introduction": "Large mushrooms such as portobello, shiitake, and best of all, porcini are wonderful cooked on the grill. Their texture and flavor are meaty and juicy enhanced by the smoky flavors of the grill. The stems of shiitake are too woody to eat. Discard them and cook only the caps.",
        "ingredients": [
            "4 large fresh mushrooms, such as shiitake, portobello, or porcini",
            "3 to 4 tablespoons olive oil",
            "2 to 3 large garlic cloves",
            "2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley",
            "Salt and freshly ground black pepper"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Place a barbecue grill or broiler rack about 5 inches away from the heat source. Preheat the grill or broiler.",
            "Wipe the mushrooms clean with damp paper towels. Snap off the stems of the mushrooms and trim the ends where soil collects. Cut the stems of portobello or porcini mushrooms into thick slices. Discard the stems of shiitake mushrooms. Brush the mushrooms with oil. Arrange the caps and stems on the grill with the rounded tops of the caps toward the source of the heat. Grill until slightly browned, about 5 minutes.",
            "In a small bowl, stir together 2 tablespoons of the oil, the garlic, parsley, and salt and pepper to taste. Turn the mushroom pieces and brush with the oil mixture.",
            "Cook until the mushrooms are tender, 2 to 3 minutes more. Serve hot."
