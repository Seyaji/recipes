  "ingredients": [
    "1 pound Potato Gnocchi, through step 7",
    "2 tablespoons olive oil",
    "1 medium onion, finely chopped",
    "1 red bell pepper, seeded and chopped",
    "Pinch of crushed red pepper",
    "2 garlic cloves, finely chopped",
    "1 pound lean ground lamb",
    "1 (28- to 35-ounce) can imported Italian tomatoes with their juice, chopped",
    "1 tablespoon tomato paste",
    "1 bay leaf",
    "Salt to taste",
    "1/2 cup freshly grated Pecorino Romano or Parmigiano-Reggiano"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Prepare the gnocchi. Then, in a large skillet, cook the olive oil, onion, bell pepper, and red pepper until the vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic and cook 1 minute more.",
    "Stir in the lamb and cook 15 minutes, stirring frequently to break up any lumps, until it is no longer pink. Stir in the tomatoes. Add the tomato paste, bay leaf, and salt.",
    "Bring the sauce to a simmer and reduce the heat to low. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is thickened, about 1 1/2 hours.",
    "Bring at least 4 quarts of water to a boil. Lower the heat so that the water boils gently. Drop the gnocchi into the water a few pieces at a time. Cook 30 seconds after the gnocchi rise to the surface.",
    "Meanwhile, remove the bay leaf from the sauce. Spoon a thin layer into a large heated serving bowl. Skim the gnocchi from the pot with a slotted spoon, draining the pieces well. Add them to the bowl. Repeat with remaining gnocchi. Top with the remaining sauce and cheese. Serve hot."
