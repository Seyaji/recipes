  "introduction": "Indulge in the rich, silky texture of Golden Squash Risotto, a beloved specialty from Mantua in Lombardy. This delectable dish, made from butternut squash, emulates the sweet and buttery characteristics of the prized Italian winter varieties, bringing a touch of authentic Italian flavor to your table.",
  "ingredients": [
    "5 cups Chicken Broth",
    "4 tablespoons unsalted butter",
    "1/4 cup finely chopped shallots or onion",
    "2 cups peeled and chopped butternut squash (about 1 pound)",
    "2 cups medium-grain rice, such as Arborio, Carnaroli, or Vialone Nano",
    "1/2 cup dry white wine",
    "Salt and freshly ground black pepper",
    "1/2 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Prepare the broth, if necessary. Bring the broth to a simmer over medium heat, then lower the heat so that it just keeps the broth hot. In a wide heavy saucepan, melt three tablespoons of the butter over medium heat. Add the shallots and cook, stirring often until golden, about 5 minutes.",
    "Add the squash and 1/2 cup of the broth. Cook until the broth evaporates.",
    "Add the rice and cook, stirring with a wooden spoon until hot, about 2 minutes. Stir in the wine until it evaporates.",
    "Add 1/2 cup of the hot broth and stir until the liquid is absorbed. Continue adding the broth 1/2 cup at a time, stirring after each addition. Adjust the heat so that the liquid simmers rapidly but the rice does not stick to the pan. Halfway through the cooking, stir in salt and pepper to taste.",
    "Use only as much of the broth as needed until the rice becomes tender yet firm to the bite and the risotto is creamy. When you think it may be done, taste a few grains. If not ready, test again in a minute or so. If the broth runs out before the rice is tender, use hot water. Cooking time will be 18 to 20 minutes.",
    "Remove the risotto pan from the heat. Stir in the remaining butter and the cheese. Serve immediately."
