  "introduction": "Shrimp in Anchovy Sauce, or Gamberi in Salsa di Acciughe, is a delightful seafood dish inspired by the exquisite flavors of the Mediterranean. The shrimp are split and opened flat to ensure they thoroughly absorb the rich and savory anchovy sauce. This dish perfectly balances the slight brininess of anchovies with the freshness of parsley, garlic, and lemon juice, creating a unique and delicious flavor profile.",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 1/2 pounds jumbo shrimp",
    "4 tablespoons unsalted butter",
    "3 tablespoons olive oil",
    "2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley",
    "2 large garlic cloves, very finely chopped",
    "6 anchovy fillets, chopped",
    "1/3 cup dry white wine",
    "2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice",
    "Salt and freshly ground black pepper"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Peel the shrimp, leaving the tail sections intact. With a small knife, slit the shrimp lengthwise along the back, cutting almost all the way through to the other side. Remove the dark vein and open the shrimp flat like a book. Rinse the shrimp and pat dry.",
    "Place a barbecue grill or broiler rack about 5 inches away from the heat source. Preheat the grill or broiler. In a large broiler-safe skillet, melt the butter with the olive oil over medium heat. When the butter foam subsides, add the parsley, garlic, and anchovies and cook, stirring 1 minute. Add the wine and lemon juice and cook 1 minute more.",
    "Remove the skillet from the heat. Add the shrimp cut-sides down. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Spoon some of the sauce over the shrimp.",
    "Run the pan under the broiler and cook about 3 minutes or until the shrimp are just opaque. Serve immediately."
