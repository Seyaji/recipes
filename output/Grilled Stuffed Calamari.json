    "introduction": "Grilled Stuffed Calamari is a delightful dish where the succulent body cavities of calamari are stuffed with an aromatic mixture of breadcrumbs, cheese, garlic, and fresh parsley. Originating from Puglia in southern Italy, these stuffed calamari are carefully prepared and grilled to perfection, creating an exquisite flavor that is both rich and satisfying. Served hot with lemon wedges, this dish is a wonderful addition to any Mediterranean-inspired meal.",
    "ingredients": [
      "8 to 12 large calamari (squid), about 6 to 8 inches long, cleaned",
      "1 cup plain dry bread crumbs",
      "1/4 cup olive oil",
      "2 tablespoons grated Pecorino Romano or Parmigiano-Reggiano",
      "1 garlic clove, finely chopped",
      "1 tablespoon chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley",
      "Salt and freshly ground black pepper",
      "1 lemon, cut into wedges"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Make a small slit at the pointed end of each calamari. Rinse thoroughly, letting the water run through the body sac. Drain and pat dry.",
      "Stir together the bread crumbs, oil, cheese, garlic, parsley, and salt and pepper to taste. Set aside 1/4 cup of the mixture. Stuff the rest of the mixture loosely into the calamari, filling them only halfway. Tuck the tentacles into the body sac and secure them with wooden picks. Roll the calamari in the remaining bread crumb mixture.",
      "Place a barbecue grill or broiler rack about 5 inches from the heat source. Preheat the grill or broiler.",
      "Grill or broil the calamari until the bodies are opaque and lightly browned, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a platter and serve hot with lemon wedges."
