  "introduction": "Tuscans are rightly proud of their excellent sheep's milk cheese, each town boasting its own unique version. This refined recipe features one such cheese, Pecorino, paired delightfully with pears cooked in red wine and spices, all complemented by toasted walnuts. It's an elegant dessert that showcases the rich culinary tradition of Montalcino, perfect for any sophisticated palate.",
  "ingredients": [
    "6 medium Anjou, Bartlett, or Bosc pears, not too ripe",
    "1 cup dry red wine",
    "1/2 cup sugar",
    "1 (3-inch) piece cinnamon stick",
    "4 whole cloves",
    "8 ounces Pecorino Toscano, Asiago, or Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, cut into 6 pieces",
    "12 walnut halves, toasted"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "1. Place a rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 450Â°F. Arrange the pears in a baking dish just large enough to hold them upright.",
    "2. Stir together the wine and sugar until the sugar softens. Pour the mixture over the pears. Scatter the cinnamon and cloves around the pears.",
    "3. Bake the pears, basting them occasionally with the wine, 45 to 60 minutes or until they are tender when pierced with a knife. If the liquid begins to dry up before the pears are done, add a little warm water to the pan.",
    "4. Let the pears cool in the dish, basting them occasionally with the pan juices. (As the juices cool, they thicken and coat the pears with a rich red glaze.) Remove the spices.",
    "5. Serve the pears with the syrup at room temperature or slightly chilled. Place them on serving dishes with two walnut halves and a piece of the cheese."
