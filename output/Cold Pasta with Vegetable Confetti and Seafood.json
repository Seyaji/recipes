    "ingredients": [
      "1 large firm ripe tomato, cored and diced",
      "1/2 pound cooked small shrimp, cut into 1/4-inch pieces",
      "1 cup chopped cooked lobster or 1/4 pound cooked crabmeat, picked over",
      "1/4 cup snipped fresh chives",
      "1/4 cup chopped fresh basil",
      "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling",
      "Coarse salt and freshly ground black pepper",
      "1 pound thin spaghetti",
      "3/4 cup very finely chopped red bell pepper",

    ],
    "instructions": [
      "In a large serving bowl, combine the tomato with the shrimp, lobster, herbs, and olive oil. Season with salt and pepper.",
      "Bring at least 4 quarts of water to a boil in a large pot. Add 2 tablespoons of salt, then the spaghetti. Stir well, gently pushing the pasta down until it is completely covered with water. Cook over high heat, stirring frequently. About 30 seconds before the pasta is ready, add the peppers, zucchini, and carrots. Stir well. As soon as the pasta is al dente, tender yet still firm to the bite, drain it and the vegetables into a large colander placed in the sink. The vegetables will be just slightly wilted.",
      "Rinse the pasta and vegetables under cool running water. Drain well.",
      "Add the pasta to the tomato and seafood mixture. Toss well. Drizzle with additional oil and toss again. Serve immediately."
