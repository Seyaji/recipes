        "introduction": "Honey Balls, or Struffoli, are a festive and delicious treat integral to Christmas celebrations in Neapolitan homes. These crisp fritters are coated in honey, and then garnished with candied fruits and nuts, making them not only a delight to eat but also a visually stunning addition to the holiday table. They keep well for up to three days, perfect for sharing or serving over the holiday season.",
        "ingredients": [
            "1 cup all-purpose flour plus more for kneading the dough",
            "1/4 teaspoon salt",
            "2 large eggs, beaten",
            "1/2 teaspoon grated lemon or orange zest",
            "Vegetable oil for frying",
            "1 cup honey",
            "Possible garnishes: multicolored sprinkles, chopped candied orange peel, citron or cherries, toasted sliced almonds"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "1. In a large bowl, combine 1 cup flour and the salt. Add the eggs and lemon zest and stir until well blended.",
            "2. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured board and knead until smooth, about 5 minutes. Add a little more flour if the dough seems sticky. Shape the dough into a ball. Cover the dough with an overturned bowl. Let the dough rest 30 minutes.",
            "3. Cut the dough into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Roll one slice between your palms into a 1/2-inch-thick rope. Cut the rope into 1/2-inch nuggets. If the dough feels sticky, use a tiny bit of flour to dust the board or your hands. (Excess flour will cause the oil to foam up when you fry the struffoli.)",
            "4. Line a tray with paper towels. Pour about 2 inches of oil into a wide heavy saucepan. Heat the oil to 370Â°F on a frying thermometer, or until a small bit of the dough dropped into the oil sizzles and turns brown in 1 minute.",
            "5. Being careful not to splash the oil, slip just enough struffoli into the pan to fit without crowding. Cook, stirring once or twice with a slotted spoon, until the struffoli are crisp and evenly golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove the struffoli with a slotted spoon or skimmer and drain on paper towels. Repeat with the remaining dough.",
            "6. When all of the struffoli are fried, gently heat the honey just to a simmer in a large shallow saucepan. Remove from the heat. Add the drained struffoli and toss well. Pile the struffoli onto a serving plate. Decorate with the multicolored sprinkles, candied fruits, or nuts.",
            "7. To serve, break off a portion of the struffoli with two large spoons or a salad server. Store covered with an overturned bowl at room temperature up to 3 days."
