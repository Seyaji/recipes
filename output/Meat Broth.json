  "title": "Meat Broth",
  "titleAlternative": "Brodo di Carne",
  "yield": "Makes about 4 quarts",
  "introduction": "Here is a basic broth made from different kinds of meat to use for soups, risotti, and stews. A good broth should be full of flavor but not so aggressive that it takes over the flavor of the dish. Beef, veal, and poultry can be used, but avoid pork or lamb. Their flavor is strong and can overwhelm the broth. Vary the proportions of the meats for this broth to your own taste or according to the ingredients you have on hand.",
  "ingredients": [
    "2 pounds meaty beef bones",
    "2 pounds veal shoulder with bones",
    "2 pounds chicken or turkey parts",
    "2 carrots, trimmed and cut into 3 or 4 pieces",
    "2 celery ribs with leaves, cut into 3 or 4 pieces",
    "2 medium onions, peeled but left whole",
    "1 large tomato or 1 cup chopped canned tomatoes",
    "1 garlic clove",
    "3 or 4 sprigs fresh flat-leaf parsley with stems"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "1. In a large stockpot, combine the meat, bones, and chicken parts. Add 6 quarts cold water and bring to a simmer over medium heat.",
    "2. Adjust the heat so that the water is barely simmering. Skim off the foam and fat that rises to the surface of the broth.",
    "3. When the foam stops rising, add the remaining ingredients. Cook 3 hours, regulating the heat so that the liquid bubbles gently.",
    "4. Let the broth cool briefly, then strain it into plastic storage containers. The broth can be used right away, or let it cool completely, then cover and store it in the refrigerator up to 3 days or in the freezer up to 3 months."
