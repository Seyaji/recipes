          "Cook fish for 8 to 10 minutes per inch of thickness.",
          "Press the fish at its thickest part; it should feel firmer than before cooking.",

          "Whole fish should be checked near the main bone or along the back.",
          "Fish like tuna, salmon, and swordfish are best cooked rare to medium-rare."
