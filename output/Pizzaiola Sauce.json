        "introduction": "Pizzaiola Sauce, derived from the Neapolitan tradition, embodies the essence of Italian culinary artistry. Typically, this sauce is used to flavor small steaks or chops, but it also pairs wonderfully with spaghetti. Contrary to its name, it is not commonly used on pizza due to the extreme heat of wood-fired ovens, which would overcook the already prepared sauce. The combination of tomatoes, garlic, and oregano makes this sauce distinctively flavorful.",
