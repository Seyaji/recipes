  "introduction": "Nutty and buttery, these crescent-shaped cookies from Piedmont are perfect for Christmas. Though they are often made with hazelnuts, walnuts give a wonderfully rich flavor. Almonds can also be substituted for a different twist. These cookies can be conveniently prepared using a food processor, or you can opt to use a blender or nut grinder followed by hand mixing.",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 cup walnut pieces",
    "1/3 cup sugar plus 1 cup more for rolling the cookies",
    "2 cups all-purpose flour",
    "1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Grease and flour 2 large baking sheets.",
    "In a food processor, combine the walnuts and sugar. Process until the nuts are finely chopped. Add the flour and process until blended.",
    "Add the butter a little at a time and pulse to blend. Remove the dough from the container and squeeze it together with your hands.",
    "Pour the remaining 1 cup of sugar into a shallow bowl. Pinch off a piece of dough the size of a walnut and form it into a ball. Shape the ball into a crescent, tapering the ends. Gently roll the crescent in sugar. Place the crescent on a prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining dough and sugar, placing each cookie about 1 inch apart.",
    "Bake 15 minutes or until lightly browned. Place the baking sheets on wire racks to cool 5 minutes.",
    "Transfer the cookies to the racks to cool completely. Store in an airtight container up to 2 weeks."
