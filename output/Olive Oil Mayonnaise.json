  "introduction": "Homemade mayonnaise makes all the difference when served simply, whether slathered on ripe tomatoes, hard-cooked eggs, poached fish, sliced chicken, or in sandwiches. Using a mild-flavored extra-virgin olive oil or a blend of full-flavored and vegetable oil enhances the taste, and making it by hand or with an electric mixer ensures the perfect texture.",
  "ingredients": [
    "2 large egg yolks, at room temperature",
    "2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice",
    "1/4 teaspoon salt",
    "1 cup extra-virgin olive oil or 1/2 cup vegetable oil plus 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "In a medium bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, lemon juice, and salt until pale yellow and thick.",
    "Continue whisking while very gradually adding the oil by drops until the mixture begins to stiffen. As it turns thick, whisk in the remaining oil more steadily, making sure that it is absorbed before adding more. If at any time the oil stops being absorbed, stop adding the oil and whisk rapidly until the sauce is smooth again.",
    "Taste and adjust seasoning. Serve immediately or cover and refrigerate up to 2 days."
