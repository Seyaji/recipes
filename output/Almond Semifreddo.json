  "introduction": "Almond Semifreddo is a delightful Italian dessert known for its creamy, soft texture that stays frozen but melts easily in the mouth. This 'half-cold' treat pairs wonderfully with warm chocolate sauce.",
  "ingredients": [
    "3/4 cup chilled heavy or whipping cream",
    "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract",
    "3/4 cup sugar",
    "1/4 cup water",
    "4 large eggs, at room temperature",
    "6 amaretti cookies, finely crushed",
    "2 tablespoons toasted almonds, finely chopped",
    "2 tablespoons sliced almonds"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Line a 9 × 5 × 3–inch metal loaf pan with plastic wrap, leaving a 2-inch overhang on the ends. Chill the pan in the freezer. At least 20 minutes before you are ready to whip the cream, place a large bowl and the beaters of an electric mixer in the refrigerator.",
    "When ready, remove the bowl and beaters from the refrigerator. Pour the cream and vanilla into the bowl and whip the cream at high speed until it holds its shape softly when the beaters are lifted, about 4 minutes. Return the bowl to the refrigerator.",
    "In a small saucepan, combine the sugar and water. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, then cook, stirring occasionally, until the sugar is completely dissolved, about 2 minutes.",
    "In a large mixer bowl, beat the eggs with the mixer on medium speed until foamy, about 1 minute. Slowly beat the hot sugar syrup into the eggs in a thin stream. Continue beating until the mixture is very light and fluffy and feels cool to the touch, 8 to 10 minutes.",
    "With a flexible spatula, gently fold the whipped cream into the egg mixture. Gently fold in the cookie crumbs and chopped almonds.",
    "Scrape the mixture into the prepared loaf pan. Cover securely with the plastic wrap and freeze 4 hours up to overnight.",
    "Unwrap the pan. Invert a serving plate on top of the pan. Holding the plate and pan together, invert them both. Lift off the pan and carefully remove the plastic wrap. Sprinkle with the sliced almonds.",
    "Cut into slices and serve immediately."
