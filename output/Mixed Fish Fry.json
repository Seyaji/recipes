  "introduction": "Mixed Fish Fry, or Gran Fritto Misto di Pesce, offers a delightful medley of seafood including calamari, small fish like whitebait, anchovies or sardines, and shrimp. A light flour coating creates a delicate crust that enhances the natural flavors of the fish, making it a perfect dish to enjoy with a squeeze of fresh lemon.",
  "ingredients": [
    "4 ounces cleaned calamari (squid)",
    "1 pound very small fresh fish, such as whitebait, fresh (not canned) anchovies, or sardines, cleaned",
    "4 ounces small shrimp, shelled and deveined",
    "1 cup all-purpose flour",
    "1 teaspoon salt",
    "Vegetable oil for frying",
    "1 lemon, cut into wedges"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "1. Rinse the calamari and drain well. Cut the bodies into 1/2-inch rings. If large, cut each group of tentacles in half through the base. Removing the heads from small whole fish such as anchovies or sardines is optional. Whitebait are always left whole. Rinse the fish thoroughly inside and out. Pat dry.",
    "2. Stir together the flour and salt on a piece of wax paper, then spread it out.",
    "3. Line a tray with paper towels. In a deep heavy saucepan, pour enough oil to reach a depth of 2 inches, or if using an electric deep-fryer, follow the manufacturer's directions. Heat the oil to 370Â°F on a deep-frying thermometer, or until a 1-inch piece of bread dropped into the oil sizzles and browns in 1 minute.",
    "4. Toss a small handful of the fish and shellfish in the flour mixture. Shake off the excess. Using tongs, carefully slip the fish into the hot oil. Do not crowd the pan. Fry until crisp and lightly golden, about 2 minutes.",
    "5. With a slotted spoon, transfer the fish to the paper towels to drain. Keep warm in a low oven. Cook the remaining seafood in the same way. Serve hot with lemon wedges."
