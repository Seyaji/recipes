  "introduction": "Juniper berries, often used to spice up game stews, also beautifully complement salmon in this delightful dish. In this recipe, inspired by a meal in Venice, sweet red onions and juniper berries are cooked until soft, creating a flavorful sauce that enhances the salmon steaks.",
  "ingredients": [
    "3 tablespoons olive oil",
    "4 salmon steaks, about 3/4 inch thick",
    "Salt and freshly ground black pepper",
    "2 medium red onions, thinly sliced",
    "1/2 teaspoon juniper berries",
    "1/2 cup dry white wine"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "In a medium skillet, heat the oil over medium heat. Pat the salmon steaks dry and place them in the pan. Cook until browned, about 3 minutes. Turn the salmon steaks and brown on the other side, about 2 minutes more. With a spatula, remove the steaks to a plate. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.",
    "Add the onions, juniper berries, and salt to taste to the pan. Add the wine and bring to a simmer. Lower the heat and cover the pan. Cook 20 minutes or until the onions are soft.",
    "Return the salmon steaks to the pan and spoon the onions over the fish. Turn the heat to medium. Cover and cook about 2 minutes more or until the fish is just barely opaque when cut in the thickest part. Serve immediately."
