      "step": 4,
      "description": "Grill or broil until the shrimp are pink and the scallops are lightly browned on one side, about 3 to 4 minutes.

The shrimp and scallop meat will be just barely opaque in the center. Transfer to a plate and drizzle with the remaining sauce."

  "variations": "Hard-shell clams like cherrystone, littlenecks, Manila clams, or cockles can be used instead. Alternatively, mussels from various varieties, especially farm-raised ones, can be substituted. Ensure that clams are alive when purchased and stored properly. Clean them by soaking in cold salted water and scrubbing if gritty. Mussels can be prepared similarly, removing any 'beards' if present."
