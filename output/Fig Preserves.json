  "introduction": "Fig preserves are a delightful way to capture the sweet and rich flavors of fresh figs, especially when they are in abundance during late summer. This classic treat, perfect for a cheese course or a breakfast spread on buttered walnut bread, originates from Puglia, Italy, where figs are cooked with water to make a thick syrup or dried under the sun.",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 1/2 pounds fresh ripe figs, rinsed and dried",
    "2 cups sugar",
    "2 strips lemon zest"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Peel the figs and cut them into quarters. Place them in a medium bowl with sugar and lemon zest. Stir well. Cover and refrigerate overnight.",
    "The next day, transfer the contents of the bowl to a large heavy saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the mixture thickens slightly, about 5 minutes. To test if the mixture is thick enough, place a drop of the slightly cooled liquid between your thumb and index finger. If the mixture forms a thread when the thumb and finger are slightly separated, the preserves are ready.",
    "Spoon into sterilized jars and store in the refrigerator up to 30 days."
