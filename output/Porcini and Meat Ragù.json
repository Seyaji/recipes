    "introduction": "Porcini mushrooms, called cèpes in French, are a cherished ingredient in Piedmont cuisine, especially after the rains bring their thick brown caps. Fresh porcini are a seasonal delight, while dried porcini are prized for their ability to lend a rich, woodsy flavor to sauces and braises throughout the year.",
    "ingredients": [
      "1 1/2 cups homemade Meat Broth or store-bought beef broth",
      "1 ounce dried porcini mushrooms",
      "2 cups warm water",
      "2 tablespoons olive oil",
      "2 ounces chopped pancetta",
      "1 carrot, chopped",
      "1 medium onion, chopped",
      "1 celery rib, chopped",
      "1 garlic clove, very finely chopped",
      "1 1/2 pounds ground veal",
      "1/2 cup dry white wine",
      "Salt and freshly ground black pepper",
      "1 cup chopped fresh or canned imported Italian tomatoes",
      "1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Prepare the broth, if necessary. In a medium bowl, soak the mushrooms in the water for 30 minutes. Lift the mushrooms out of the soaking liquid. Strain the liquid through a paper coffee filter or a piece of dampened cheesecloth into a clean bowl and set aside. Rinse the mushrooms under running water, paying special attention to the base where soil collects. Finely chop the mushrooms.",
      "Pour the oil into a large saucepan. Add the pancetta and cook over medium heat about 5 minutes. Add the carrot, onion, celery, and garlic and cook, stirring frequently, until tender and golden, about 10 minutes more. Add the veal and cook until lightly browned, stirring frequently to break up the lumps. Add the wine and cook 1 minute. Season to taste with salt and pepper.",
      "Add the tomatoes, mushrooms, nutmeg, and reserved mushroom liquid. Bring to a simmer. Cook 1 hour or until the sauce is thickened. Serve hot. Can be made ahead and stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator up to 3 days or in the freezer up to 2 months."
