  "instructions": [
    "Soak the bread in the water for 5 minutes. Squeeze out the water.",
    "In a large bowl, combine the soaked bread, sausage, veal, pistachios, rosemary, and garlic. Stir in the eggs and salt and pepper to taste.",
    "Place a long piece of plastic wrap on a flat surface. Lay the lamb on the plastic, boned-side up. Cover the lamb with another sheet of plastic wrap. Pound the lamb gently with the flat side of a mallet to a 1-inch thickness; make it as even as possible. Remove the top sheet of plastic. Sprinkle the lamb with salt and pepper.",
    "Spread the meat mixture over the lamb, leaving a 1-inch border all around. Beginning at a longer end, roll the lamb lengthwise into a cylinder or sausage shape. Wrap kitchen string around the length of the lamb roll, thread the string under and back along the length of the roll, and knot the string on the other side to secure it.",
    "In a large Dutch oven or other deep, heavy pot with a tight-fitting lid, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the lamb roll and brown well on all sides, turning the meat with tongs, about 20 minutes. Scatter the onion, celery, and carrot around the meat. Cook until the onion has wilted, about 5 minutes.",
    "Add the Marsala and bring to a boil. Add one cup of the broth and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to low, then cover and cook 3 hours, turning the meat occasionally. Add more of the broth if needed.",
    "When the meat is tender when pierced with a fork, transfer it to a cutting board and cover with foil to keep it warm. Skim the fat from the pan juices. Pour the contents of the pot into a food processor or blender to puree. Taste and adjust seasoning.",
    "Return the sauce to the pot and reheat gently. Slice the meat and serve it hot with the sauce."
