  "introduction": "In the Veneto region, Beet Ravioli with Poppy Seeds is a traditional dish often served during Christmas. Originating from the Alpine town of Cortina d'Ampezzo, these ravioli are visually striking with a red beet filling that gently blushes through the pasta. The addition of poppy seeds in the sauce brings an Austrian influence to this delightful dish.",
  "ingredients": [
    "4 medium beets, trimmed and scrubbed",
    "1/2 cup whole or part-skim ricotta",
    "1 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano",
    "2 tablespoons plain dry bread crumbs",
    "Salt and freshly ground black pepper",
    "1 pound Fresh Egg Pasta, rolled out and cut into 4-inch strips",
    "8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter",
    "1 tablespoon poppy seeds"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Place the beets in a medium saucepan with cold water to cover. Bring to a simmer and cook until tender when pierced with a knife, about 30 minutes. Drain and let cool.",
    "Peel the beets and cut them into chunks. Place them in a food processor and chop finely. Add the ricotta, 1/2 cup of the Parmigiano-Reggiano, bread crumbs, and salt and pepper to taste. Process just until blended but still slightly coarse.",
    "Prepare the pasta. Make and cook the ravioli as described in the recipe for Cheese Ravioli, Steps 2 to 6.",
    "Meanwhile, melt the butter with the poppy seeds and a pinch of salt. Pour half the butter into a warm serving bowl. Transfer the ravioli to the bowl. Spoon the remaining sauce over the ravioli and sprinkle with the remaining 1/2 cup of Parmigiano-Reggiano. Serve immediately."
