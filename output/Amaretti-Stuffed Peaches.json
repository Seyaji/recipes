    "introduction": "Amaretti-Stuffed Peaches, or Pesche al Forno, is a cherished dessert from Piedmont. This delightful treat pairs the sweetness of ripe peaches with the crunch of amaretti cookies, making for an irresistible combination. Whether you choose to drizzle it with heavy cream or top it with a scoop of ice cream, this dessert is sure to impress.",
    "ingredients": [
        "8 medium peaches, not too ripe",
        "8 amaretti cookies",
        "2 tablespoons softened unsalted butter",
        "2 tablespoons sugar",
        "1 large egg"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Place a rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 375Â°F. Butter a baking dish large enough to hold the peach halves in a single layer.",
        "Place the amaretti cookies in a plastic bag and crush them gently with a heavy object, such as a rolling pin. You should have about 1/2 cup. In a medium bowl, mix together the butter and sugar and stir in the crumbs.",
        "Following the line around the peaches, cut them in half and remove the pits. With a grapefruit spoon or a melon baller, scoop out a little of the peach flesh from the center to widen the opening and add it to the crumb mixture. Stir the egg into the mixture.",
        "Arrange the peach halves cut sides up in the dish. Spoon some of the crumb mixture into each peach half.",
        "Bake 1 hour or until the peaches are tender. Serve hot or at room temperature."
