    "titleAlternative": "Asparagi allo Zabaione",
    "yield": "Makes 6 servings",
    "introduction": "Zabaglione is a fluffy egg custard traditionally sweetened for dessert, but here it's transformed into a savory delight. Beaten with white wine instead of sugar, it makes an elegant sauce for tender, spring asparagus. Peeling the asparagus is optional but guarantees tenderness from tip to stem, making this dish a sophisticated first course.",
    "ingredients": [
      "1½ pounds asparagus",
      "2 large egg yolks",
      "¼ cup dry white wine",
      "Pinch of salt",
      "1 tablespoon unsalted butter"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "1. Trim off the base of the asparagus at the point where the stem turns from white to green. To peel the asparagus, start below the tip and, using a swivel-blade peeler, strip away the dark green peel down to the stem end.",
      "2. Bring about 2 inches of water to a boil in a large skillet. Add the asparagus and salt to taste. Cook until the asparagus bend slightly when you lift them from the stem end, 4 to 8 minutes. Cooking time will depend on the thickness of the asparagus. Remove the asparagus with tongs. Drain on paper towels and pat them dry.",
      "3. Bring about an inch of water to a simmer in the bottom half of a double boiler or saucepan. Place the egg yolks, wine, and salt in the top of the double boiler, or in a heatproof bowl that fits comfortably over the saucepan without touching the water.",
      "4. Beat the egg mixture until blended, then place the pan or bowl over the simmering water. Beat with a hand-held electric mixer or with a wire whisk until the mixture is pale-colored and holds a soft shape when the beaters are lifted, about 5 minutes. Beat in the butter just until blended.",
      "5. Spoon the warm sauce over the asparagus and serve immediately."
