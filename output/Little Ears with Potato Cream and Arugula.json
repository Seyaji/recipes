  "introduction": "Delight in the rich flavors of Puglia with this comforting pasta dish. The nutty taste of wild arugula, prevalent in Puglia, pairs perfectly with the creamy potato sauce. Potatoes are treated as a versatile vegetable in Italian cuisine, adding a unique texture to pasta dishes. Cooked until tender and mashed to form a creamy base, the potatoes blend seamlessly with orecchiette (little ears) and arugula for a harmonious meal.",
  "ingredients": [
    "2 medium boiling potatoes, about 12 ounces",
    "Salt",
    "1/4 cup olive oil",

    "1 pound orecchiette or shells",
    "2 bunches arugula (about 8 ounces), tough stems removed, rinsed and drained",
    "Salt and freshly ground black pepper"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Peel the potatoes and place them in a small pot with salt to taste and cold water to cover. Bring the water to a simmer and cook the potatoes until tender when pierced with a sharp knife, about 20 minutes. Drain the potatoes, reserving the water.",
    "Pour the oil into a medium saucepan. Add the garlic and cook over medium heat until the garlic is golden, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat. Add the potatoes and mash well with a masher or fork, stirring in about a cup of the reserved water to make a thin 'cream.' Season with salt and pepper.",
    "Bring 4 quarts of water to a boil. Add 2 tablespoons of salt, then the pasta. Stir well. Cook over high heat, stirring frequently, until the pasta is al dente, tender yet firm to the bite. Add the arugula and stir once. Drain the pasta and arugula.",
    "Return the pasta and arugula to the pot and add the potato sauce. Cook and stir over low heat, adding a little more of the potato water if needed. Serve immediately."
