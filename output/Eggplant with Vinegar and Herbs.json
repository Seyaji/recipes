The tartness of red wine vinegar, balanced with the sweetness of sugar and the freshness of herbs, enriches the eggplant, making it a perfect complement for grilled tuna or swordfish.",
    "ingredients": [
      "2 medium eggplants (about 1 pound each) cut into 1-inch pieces",
      "Salt",
      "1/2 cup olive oil",
      "1/2 cup red wine vinegar",

      "2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley",
      "2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Trim the tops and bottoms of the eggplants. Cut the eggplants into 1-inch pieces. Place the pieces in a colander, sprinkling each layer with salt. Place the colander over a plate to drain for at least 30 minutes. Rinse off the salt with cool water and pat the pieces dry with paper towels.",
      "Line a tray with paper towels. Heat 1/4 cup of the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add half the eggplant pieces and cook, stirring frequently, until browned, about 15 minutes. With a slotted spoon, transfer the eggplant to the paper towels to drain. Add the remaining oil to the skillet and fry the remaining eggplant in the same way.",
      "Remove the skillet from the heat and carefully pour off any remaining oil. Carefully wipe out the skillet with paper towels.",
      "Place the skillet over medium heat and add the vinegar and sugar. Stir until the sugar is dissolved. Return all of the eggplant to the skillet and cook, stirring, until the liquid is absorbed, about 5 minutes.",
      "Transfer the eggplant to a serving dish and sprinkle with the parsley and mint. Let cool. Serve at room temperature."
