        "introduction": "Crunchy chocolate nut slices that require no baking are a specialty of Piedmont. These delightful cookies offer a combination of crispness and rich chocolate flavor, enhanced over time as the ingredients meld together. Feel free to experiment by substituting the amaretti cookies with vanilla or chocolate wafers, graham crackers, or shortbread. For those who prefer not to use liqueur, a splash of orange juice works just as well.",
