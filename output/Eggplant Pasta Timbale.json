    "introduction": "Eggplant Pasta Timbale is a spectacular dish perfect for parties or special occasions. This dish features pasta, cheese, and meats encased in a dome of eggplant slices. Originating from Sicily, it often includes caciocavallo cheese, which can also be substituted with provolone or Pecorino Romano. Despite its intricate appearance, it is not difficult to make, though care must be taken when unmolding it hot from the oven.",
    "ingredients": [
      "2 medium eggplants (about 1 pound each)",
      "Salt",
      "Olive oil",
      "1 medium onion, chopped",
      "1 garlic clove, finely chopped",
      "8 ounces ground beef",
      "8 ounces Italian pork sausages, skinned and chopped",
      "2 pounds fresh tomatoes, peeled, seeded, and chopped, or 1 (28-ounce) can imported Italian peeled tomatoes, chopped",
      "1 cup fresh or frozen peas",
      "Freshly ground black pepper",
      "1 pound perciatelli or bucatini",
      "12 ounces mozzarella, chopped",
      "1 cup freshly grated caciocavallo or Pecorino Romano",
      "3 ounces salami, chopped",
      "2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil",
      "2 hard cooked eggs, sliced"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Cut the eggplant lengthwise into 1/4-inch thick slices. Sprinkle the slices generously with salt and place them in a colander to drain for at least 30 minutes. Rinse the slices and blot dry.",
      "Heat 1/4-inch of oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry the slices a few at a time until lightly browned on both sides, about 5 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels.",
      "Pour the oil into a large saucepan. Add the onion and garlic and cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the onion is softened, about 5 minutes. Add the beef and sausage meat. Cook, stirring often, until lightly browned, about 10 minutes.",
      "Add the tomatoes and salt and pepper to taste. Cook on low heat for 20 minutes. Add the peas and cook for 10 minutes more or until the sauce is thickened.",
      "Bring at least 4 quarts of water to a boil in a large pot. Add 2 tablespoons of salt, then the pasta. Stir well. Cook over high heat, stirring frequently, until the pasta is tender but still very firm. Drain the pasta and return it to the pot. Toss the pasta with the sauce. Let cool for 5 minutes.",
      "Line a 4-quart ovenproof bowl or baking dish with foil, pressing it smoothly against the sides. Brush the foil with olive oil. Starting in the center of the bowl, arrange half the eggplant slices, overlapping slightly against the inside and reserving a few slices for the top.",
      "Add the mozzarella, grated cheese, salami, and basil to the pan with the pasta and toss well. Add half the pasta to the prepared bowl, being careful not to disturb the eggplant. Arrange the egg slices over the pasta. Top with the remaining pasta and the reserved eggplant slices. Press down lightly.",
      "Place a rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 400°F. Bake for 45 to 60 minutes, or until hot in the center, 140°F measured on an instant-read thermometer. (Exact baking time will depend on the diameter of the bowl.)",
      "Let the timbale stand for 15 minutes. Invert the bowl onto a serving plate. Remove the bowl and gently peel off the foil. Serve immediately."
