  "introduction": "Tasty little clams dusted with crunchy seasoned bread crumbs are a favorite all over southern Italy. Perfect as an antipasto or a main course, these clams are best made with small to medium-sized specimens. Enjoy them hot from the broiler with a squeeze of fresh lemon.",
  "ingredients": [
    "4 dozen small hard-shell clams",
    "1/2 cup water",
    "1/2 cup plain dry bread crumbs, preferably homemade",
    "1/4 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano or Pecorino Romano",
    "1/4 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley",
    "1 garlic clove, finely chopped",
    "Salt and freshly ground black pepper",
    "About 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil",
    "1 lemon, cut into wedges"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Soak the clams in cold water for 30 minutes. Scrub with a brush under cold running water. Discard any with cracked shells or that do not close tightly when touched.",
    "Place the clams in a large pot with the water. Cover and bring to a simmer. After about 5 minutes, remove the clams as they open and place them in a bowl. Discard clams that don't open.",
    "Pour the clam juices into a bowl. Remove the clams from their shells and rinse each one in the liquid to remove any sand. Separate the shell halves. Place half the shells on a large baking sheet. Place a clam in each shell. Strain the clam juice through a paper coffee filter or dampened cheesecloth into a bowl. Spoon a little of the juice on each clam.",
    "Preheat the broiler. In a medium bowl, combine the bread crumbs, cheese, parsley, garlic, and salt and pepper to taste. Add enough oil to moisten the crumbs. Spoon a small amount of the crumbs loosely on top of each clam. Do not pack the crumbs down.",
    "Broil 4 minutes or until the crumbs are lightly browned. Serve hot with lemon wedges."
